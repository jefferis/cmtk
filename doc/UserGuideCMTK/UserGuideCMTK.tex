\noindent
This paper is intended as a very brief introduction of the main tools in the
Computational Morphometry Toolkit (CMTK). The target audience are CMTK users,
who might use this codument as a reference to the most common processing
tasks, and prospective users, who may find this information useful to
determine whether CMTK provides functionality that they can use.

\section{Introduction}

The Computational Morphometry Toolkit, or short CMTK, is a set of software
tools that perform various types of processing and analysis on
three-dimensional (3D) image data. CMTK is available both in source code
(licensed under the GNU GPL3) and as pre-compiled binaries from
\url{http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cmtk/}.


\section{Step-by-Step}

\subsection{DICOM Image Stacker}

When dealing with 3D medical image data in particular, the first step of
processing is usually the conversion of a stack of single-slice image files in
DICOM format to a single-file 3D image. To this end, CMTK provides a tool that
can search through a file system tree, find all DICOM files in it, group the
ones that form 3D image volumes, and write each of these volumes into a
separate file in one of the supported formats.

For example, the command
\begin{verbatim}
dcm2image --recurse --out-pattern image_%02d.nii /path/to/dicom
\end{verbatim}
or short
\begin{verbatim}
dcm2image -r -O image_%02d.nii /path/to/dicom
\end{verbatim}
would recursively search the file system under {\tt /path/to/dicom} and write
all resulting image volumes to consecutively numbered image files in NIFTI
format, {\tt image\_01.nii},  {\tt image\_01.nii}, and so on.

\subsection{Interleaved Image Motion Artifact Correction}

\subsection{MR Intensity Bias Field Correction}

\begin{verbatim}
levelset levelset.nii
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
mrbias -M 2 --mask levelset.nii spgr.nii spgr_corrected.nii
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Affine Image Registration}


\begin{verbatim}
registration -o afine.xform --dofs 6 --dofs 9 --auto-multi-level 4 spgr1.nii spgr2.nii
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Nonrigid Image Registration}

\cite{RuecSonoHaye:1999} \cite{RohlMaur:2003}

\begin{verbatim}
warp -o ffd.xform affine.xform
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Atlas-based Segmentation}

\subsection{Jacobian Determinant Maps}

\subsection{Statistical Testing}

\subsection{General Linear Modeling}
