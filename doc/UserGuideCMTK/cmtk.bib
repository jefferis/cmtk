  abstract =     {One major problem with nonrigid image registration
                  techniques is their high computational cost. Because of
                  this, these methods have found limited application to
                  clinical situations where fast execution is required, e.g.,
                  intra-operative imaging. This paper presents a parallel
                  implementation of a nonrigid image registration
                  algorithm. It takes advantage of shared-memory
                  multiprocessor computer architectures using multithreaded
                  programming by partitioning of data and partitioning of
                  tasks, depending on the computational subproblem. For three
                  different biomedical applications (intra-operative brain
                  deformation, contrast-enhanced MR mammography, inter-subject
                  brain registration), the scaling behavior of the algorithm
                  is quantitatively analyzed. The method is demonstrated to
                  perform the computation of intra-operative brain deformation
                  in less than a minute using 64 CPUs on a 128-CPU
                  shared-memory supercomputer (SGI Origin 3800). It is shown
                  that its serial component is no more than 2 percent of the
                  total computation time, allowing a speedup of at least a
                  factor of 50. In most cases, the theoretical limit of the
                  speedup is substantially higher (up to 132-fold in the
                  application examples presented in this paper). The parallel
                  implementation of our algorithm is therefore capable of
                  solving nonrigid registration problems with short execution
                  time requirements and may be considered an important step
                  in the application of such techniques to clinically
                  important problems such as  the computation of brain
                  deformation during cranial image-guided surgery.},

                  intensity inhomogeneity in magnetic resonance (MR) images is
                  addressed. A novel model-based correction method is
                  proposed, based on the assumption that an image corrupted by
                  intensity inhomogeneity contains more information than the
                  corresponding uncorrupted image. The image degradation
                  process is described by a linear model, consisting of a
                  multiplicative and an additive component which are modeled
                  by a combination of smoothly varying basis functions. The
                  degraded image is corrected by the inverse of the image
                  degradation model. The parameters of this model are
                  optimized such that the information of the corrected image
                  is minimized while the global intensity statistic is
                  preserved. The method was quantitatively evaluated and
                  compared to other methods on a number of simulated and real
                  MR images and proved to be effective, reliable, and
                  computationally attractive. The method can be widely applied
                  to different types of MR images because it solely uses the
                  information that is naturally present in an image, without
                  making assumptions on its spatial and intensity
                  distribution. Besides, the method requires no preprocessing,
                  parameter setting, nor user interaction. Consequently, the
                  proposed method may be a valuable tool in MR image
                  analysis.},

  abstract =	 {In this paper, we propose a new model for active contours to
                  detect objects in a given image, based on techniques of
                  curve evolution, Mumford-Shah functional for segmentation
                  and level sets. Our model can detect objects whose
                  boundaries are not necessarily defined by gradient.We
                  minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of
                  the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation,
                  the problem becomes a ``mean-curvature flow''-like evolving
                  the active contour, which will stop on the desired
                  boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the
                  gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour
                  models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation

                  entropy-based registration criteria for automated 3D
                  multi-modality medical image alignment. In this application
                  where misalignment can be large with respect to the imaged
                  field of view, invariance to overlap statistics is an
                  important consideration. Current entropy measures are
                  reviewed and a normalised measure is proposed which is
                  simply the ratio of the sum of the marginal entropies and
                  the joint entropy. The effect of changing overlap on current
                  entropy measures and this normalised measure are compared
                  using a simple image model and experiments on clinical image
                  data. Results indicate that the normalised entropy measure
                  provides significantly improved behaviour over a range of
                  imaged fields of view.},

                  finding the registration of volumetric medical images of
                  differing modalities. Registration is achieved by adjustment
                  of the relative position and orientation until the mutual
                  information between the images is maximized. In our
                  derivation of the registration procedure, few assumptions
                  are made about the nature of the imaging process. As a
                  result the algorithms are quite general and can foreseeably
                  be used with a wide variety of imaging devices. This
                  approach works directly with image data; no pre-processing
                  or segmentation is required. This technique is, however,
                  more flexible and robust than other intensity-based
                  techniques like correlation. Additionally, it has an
                  efficient implementation that is based on stochastic
                  approximation. Experiments are presented that demonstrate
                  the approach registering magnetic resonance (MR) images with
                  computed tomography (CT) images, and with positron-emission
                  tomography (PET) images. Surgical applications of the

  abstract =	 {Over the last five years, new ``voxel-based'' approaches
                  have allowed important progress in multimodal image
                  registration, notably due to the increasing use of
                  information-theoretic similarity measures. Their wide
                  success has led to the progressive abandon of measures using
                  standard image statistics (mean and variance). Until now,
                  such measures have essentially been based on heuristics. In
                  this paper, we address the determination of a new measure
                  based on standard statistics from a theoretical point of
                  view. We show that it naturally leads to a known concept of
                  probability theory, the correlation ratio. In our
                  derivation, we take as the hypothesis the functional
                  dependence between the image intensities. Although such a
                  hypothesis is not as general as possible, it enables us to
                  model the image smoothness prior very easily. We also
                  demonstrate results of multimodal rigid registration
                  involving Magnetic Resonance (MR), Computed Tomography (CT),
                  and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. These results
                  suggest that the correlation ratio provides a good trade-off
                  between accuracy and robustness.},

                  volume which are translated and rotated with respect to one
                  another. The same computational method may be used to
                  register pairs of tomographic brain images which are rotated
                  and translated in the transverse section plane. The
                  technique is based on the classical theory of rigid bodies,
                  employing as its basis the principal axes
                  transformation. The performance of the method was studied by
                  simulation and with image data from PET, XCT, and MRI. It
                  was found that random errors in determining the brain
                  contour are well tolerated. Progressively coarser axial
                  sampling of data sets led to some degradation, but
                  acceptable performance was obtained with axial sampling
                  distances up to 10 mm. Given adequate digital sampling of
                  the object volume, we conclude that registration by the
                  principal axes transformation can be accomplished with
                  typical errors in the range of ~1 mm. The advantages of the
                  technique are simplicity and speed of computation.}
