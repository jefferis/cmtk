#  ZLIB_LIBRARIES      - List of libraries when using zlib.
#  ZLIB_FOUND          - True if zlib found.
#
#  ZLIB_VERSION_STRING - The version of zlib found (x.y.z)
#  ZLIB_VERSION_MAJOR  - The major version of zlib
#  ZLIB_VERSION_MINOR  - The minor version of zlib
#  ZLIB_VERSION_PATCH  - The patch version of zlib
#  ZLIB_VERSION_TWEAK  - The tweak version of zlib
#
# The following variable are provided for backward compatibility
#
#  ZLIB_MAJOR_VERSION  - The major version of zlib
#  ZLIB_MINOR_VERSION  - The minor version of zlib
#  ZLIB_PATCH_VERSION  - The patch version of zlib
