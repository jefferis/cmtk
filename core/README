Release Notes -- CMTK 1.5.1
===========================

This is a bugfix release, which fixes a major inconsistency in the way CMTK's
tools were writing image files. Most, but not all, tools would write their
output images in RAS pixel array order (or LAS, when writing Analyze 7.5 image
files). Starting with this release, all tools will write output files in the
same array order and orientation is the respective input files, i.e., the
storage of input and output files on disk should match each other pixel for
pixel.

For backward compatibility, the old behaviour can be turned back on by
defining the "CMTK_LEGACY_WRITE_IMAGES_RAS" environment variable.

For a complete list of changes and fixes, see the CHANGELOG file.
