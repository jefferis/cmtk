Release Notes -- CMTK 1.3.1
===========================

This is a bugfix and minor feature release of CMTK.

The major change in this release relates to the bundled zlib library. First,
the library code has been updated to the latest available release,
1.2.5. Second, on systems where zlib is already installed, CMTK will now
require to use that and will refuse to build and use the bundled zlib. This is
to avoid version problems when Qt support is also activated, as Qt is commonly
dynamically linked against the system zlib.

The second relevant change relates to writing of compressed vs. uncompressed
image files. When writing images in NIFTI format, comp[ression can now be
activated by appending ".gz" to the output path, even when the
CMTK_WRITE_UNCOMPRESSED environment variable is defined.

For a complete list of changes and fixes, see the CHANGELOG file.
