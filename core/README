Release Notes -- CMTK 1.4.1
===========================

This is a bug fix and minor feature release.

This release adds GPU-accelerated versions of two more tools: image symmetry
plane computation ("symplx_cuda") and simple two-phase levelset segmentation
("levelset_cuda"). The previously released "mrbias_cuda" tool was broken and
is also fixed with this release.

The entire library has been refactored to use relative paths for header file
inclusion, which should reduce the file system scan operations and thus
improve build times.

For a complete list of changes and fixes, see the CHANGELOG file.
