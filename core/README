Release Notes -- CMTK 1.2.0
===========================

This is a feature release that adds new, clean implementations of pairwise
affine and nonrigid image registration. The new "registrationx" tool will
eventually replace the "registration" tool, and "warpx" will replace "warp".

These new tools should still be considered experimental, as they have not
yet been tuned to achieve the same level of accuracy and robustness as the 
old implementations. The new code is also significantly slower, but 
potentially more accurate and it also has support for using arbitrary 
interpolation kernels for the floating image. We will also be making changes
to the command line arguments supported by both tools to streamline things
and make everything more intuitive and consistent.

We have also added a new tool, "convertx", to ultimately replace the old
"convert" tool. The main improvement here is that "convertx" will perform
all optional image operations in the exact order as they are given on the
command line, with support for arbitrary repititions.

For more information and a complete list of changes and fixes, see the 
the CHANGELOG file.
