Release Notes -- CMTK 1.5.4
===========================

This release introduces two new groupwise image registration tools, which
replace the four previous tools. The tool "groupwise_affine" replaces the
"groupwise_rmi" and "congeal" tools. The tool "groupwise_warp" replaces the
"groupwise_rmi_warp" and "congeal_warp" tools. Each of the new tools supports
command line options "--rmi" and "--congeal", which select the algorithm
underlying one of the two tools that the respecitve new tool replaces.

The  "film", "volume_injection", and "volume_reconstruction" now have more
logical and consistent command line options. This leads to incompatibility
with some of their previous options. The "volume_reconstruction" tool also now
defaults to cubic, rather than linear, inverse interpolation.

For a complete list of changes and fixes, see the CHANGELOG file.
