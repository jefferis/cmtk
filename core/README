Release Notes -- CMTK 1.1.2
===========================

This is a minor bugfix and feature release for the 1.1 series of CMTK.
The major enhancement introduced with this release is a completely
re-designed thread execution framework for multi-processor computation.
Instead of starting threads as needed throughout the life of a process,
a persistent pool of threads is now allocated once when a program begins
execution. These threads can then execute different tasks as needed.

While the new threading framework causes a small performance penalty
on Linux systems (about 5%), it vastly improves performance of the native
Windows build. The new framework has the additional benefit that it enables
dynamic load balancing between threads, which benefits all platforms.


For more information, see the CHANGELOG file.

CMTK has been built and tested on the following platforms:

- Linux 32bit (Fedora 9), gcc 4.3.0
- Linux 64bit (Fedora 9), gcc 4.3.0
