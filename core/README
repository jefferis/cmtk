Release Notes -- CMTK 1.0.1
===========================

This is a bugfix and minor featur release. Two command line tools, "regress"
and "probe_xform" were missing for the 1.0.0 builds. These have been
added. Some command line options of the "warp" and "registration" tools have
changed due to internal reorganization and unification of image
preprocessing. Finally, a tool and script for validation of rigid registration
using RIRE data have been added.

CMTK has been built and tested on the following platforms:

- Linux 32bit (Fedora 10), gcc 4.3.0
- Linux 64bit (Fedora 10), gcc 4.3.0
- Linux 32bit (Fedora 11), gcc 4.4.0

- Cygwin, gcc 4.3.2 beta2
