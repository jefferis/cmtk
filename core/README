Release Notes -- CMTK 1.1.0-rc1
===============================

This is a major feature upgrade of CMTK. The toolkit now provides a working
implementation of the Slicer3 Execution Model for command line-based
plugins. Currently, the tools "levelset", "mrbias", "registration", "warp",
and "film" support slicer integration.

As an additional improvement, we are now including a minimal, stripped-down
version of the OFFIS DCMTK tookit. This allows for convenient building of CMTK
with DICOM support on all platforms.

NOTE: due to a major design change to eliminate redundant and inconsistent
legacy code, results of the rigid and affine registration algorithm will
change when compared with results computed using previous versions of CMTK. We
have re-validated CMTK's registration with data from the RIRE project, and the
achieved registration accuracies are essentially identical.

Nevertheless, there is a realistic chance that we have introduced bugs in the
way that the vaious input, output, and initial transformations are handled. We
are therefore prodiving a "release candidate" to remind early adopters to be
careful and perform sanity checks on all outputs related to rigid and nonrigid
registrartion.

For more information, see the CHANGELOG file.
