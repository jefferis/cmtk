Release Notes -- CMTK 1.1.0
===============================

This is a major feature upgrade of CMTK. The toolkit now provides a working
implementation of the Slicer3 Execution Model for command line-based
plugins. Currently, the tools "levelset", "mrbias", "registration", "warp",
"film", and "make_initial_affine" support slicer integration.

As an additional improvement, we are now including a minimal, stripped-down
version of the OFFIS DCMTK tookit. This allows for convenient building of CMTK
with DICOM support on all platforms.

NOTE: due to a major design change to eliminate redundant and inconsistent
legacy code, results of the rigid and affine registration algorithm will
change when compared with results computed using previous versions of CMTK. We
have re-validated CMTK's registration with data from the RIRE project, and the
achieved registration accuracies are essentially identical.

For more information, see the CHANGELOG file.

CMTK has been built and tested on the following platforms:

- Linux 32bit (Fedora 9), gcc 4.3.0
- Linux 64bit (Fedora 9), gcc 4.3.0
