Release Notes -- CMTK 1.1.3
===========================

This is a minor bugfix and feature release for the 1.1 series of CMTK.
The major enhancement introduced with this release is support for building
using the SunPro CC compiler suite. This has allowed us to add two new binary
builds, for Solaris on i386 and x86_64. While we are not providing a build for
Solaris on SPARC, CMTK should build with no problems using the Sun CC compiler
on that hardware as well.

Minor improvements in this release include a new tool to analyze deformation
fields, two scripts for shape averaging and multi-acquisition motion
correction, as well as better command line documentations.


For more information, see the CHANGELOG file.
