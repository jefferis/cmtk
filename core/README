Release Notes -- CMTK 1.4.0
===========================

This release adds initial support for GPU computation, currently implemented
only for the CUDA programming model. The library design facilitiates future
implementation of algorithms using OpenCL, but for now we found CUDA to be the
more robust and elegant programming interface.

Due to limited access to appropriately equipped build systems CUDA support
will tested only on 32bit and 64bit Linux, although binary packages built
using VisualStudio 2008 on Windoes will also be provided. CUDA Release 3.0 (or
later) must be installed to run tools with GPU support, but non-CUDA tools
should run on all systems.

Note that this release removes direct support for building against VTK, The
Visualization Toolkit.

For a complete list of changes and fixes, see the CHANGELOG file.

CMTK has been built and tested on the following platforms:

- Linux 32bit (Fedora 13), gcc 4.4.4
- Linux 64bit (Fedora 13), gcc 4.4.4
- Cygwin, gcc 4.3.4
- Windows XP, VisualStudio 9 (2008 Express Edition)
- Windows XP, VisualStudio 10 (2010 Express Edition)
- MacOS X, PowerPC, gcc 4.0.1
- Solaris, x86_64, gcc 3.4.3
- Solaris, x86_64, gcc 4.3.4
- Solaris, i386, Sun C++ 5.10
- Solaris, x86_64, Sun C++ 5.10
