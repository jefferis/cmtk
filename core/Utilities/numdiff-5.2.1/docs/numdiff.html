I want to thank Mr. Norman Clerman <a href="mailto:norm(dot)opcon(at)fuse(dot)net">norm(dot)opcon(at)fuse(dot)net</a>
for several suggestions he gave me to improve the readability
and the effectiveness of the output produced by Numdiff. 
He also pointed out the need to implement a filter
to resynchronize the lines between two files in case of
addition or deletion of one or more lines. 
I have to give him credit for the urge to prepare the
versions 4.x and 5.x of Numdiff.

   <p>Moreover, I want to thank my friends Mariapia Palombaro,
since she removed some errors while
reviewing the first version of this document, and
Paolo Caramanica, who suggested me to add more
information to the output of the option <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp>.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Overview</h2>

Computer users often find occasion to ask how two files differ. 
Perhaps one file is a newer version of the other file.  Or maybe the
two files started out as identical copies but were changed by different
people.

   <p>There are several ways to think about the differences between two
files.  One way to think of the differences is as a series of lines
that were deleted from, inserted in, or changed in one file to produce
the other file. 
The well-known <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> program compares two files line by line,
finds groups of lines that differ, and reports each group of differing lines. 
Without particular options, the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> program considers any
change in the amount or in the type of the characters as a
relevant difference. However, trough some command line options
it also provides ways to suppress certain kinds of
differences that are not important to the user. 
For instance, <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> provides ways to ignore differences
in the amount of white space between words or lines, or
differences in alphabetic case.

   <p>Another way to think of the differences is as a series of words
that were deleted from, inserted in, or changed in one file to produce
the other file. 
Here &ldquo;word&rdquo; refers to a sequence of non white-space characters
delimited by a couple of white-spaces, one before and the other
one after the word.

   <p>The less known <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> program by Franc,ois Pinard
<a href="mailto:pinard(at)iro(dot)umontreal(dot)ca">pinard(at)iro(dot)umontreal(dot)ca</a>
compares words in two files and reports the differences.

   <p>At last, one can think of the differences between two files as a
sequence of pairs of bytes that can be either identical or different. 
The <samp><span class="command">cmp</span></samp> program reports the differences between two files
byte by byte, instead of line by line or word by word. 
As a result, it is often more useful than <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>
for comparing binary files.

   <p>However, none of these approaches turns out to be good when
you want to compare a couple of text files composed
partially or entirely by numerical fields. 
Indeed, when you compare a couple of such files,
what you want to obtain usually is a list of the numerical fields
in the second file which <strong>numerically</strong> differ
from the corresponding fields in the first file. 
But, as you probably knows, a same number can be written
using different notations and programs like <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>
can not recognize whether a difference between two numeric fields
is only due to the notation or is actually a difference of numerical
values.

   <p>For instance, 11.23   and   11.2300000
are the same number but represented in different ways. 
While, if you are interested in the numerical values, it is obvious
that the difference in the representation is not meaningful
and then it should be ignored, however <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp>
consider the previous one as a relevant difference and there
is no way for you to tell these programs to ignore it !

   <p>Another example of this type is given by
98765.4321  and  9.87654321E04
where the difference is only due to the use
of the scientific notation in place of the ordinary decimal notation.

   <p>Moreover, depending on your country you could stick
to different conventions in writing numbers. 
For instance, the amount &ldquo;three hundred millions and
fifty-two thousands of dollars and forty-six cents&rdquo;
is usually written by an Italian accountant as 300.052.000,46$
while an American accountant would write 300,052,000.46$. 
Of course, 300.052.000,46$  and  300,052,000.46$
represent the same amount of money but
<samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> would report a difference,
which probably is not what you want in a similar
case.

   <p>At last, sometimes you could want to ignore even
differences in numerical values as long as they do not
overcome a certain threshold. In other words,
you could desire to suppress all &ldquo;small&rdquo; numerical
differences too.

   <p>For instance, it could happen that you want to ignore
all numerical differences whose absolute value is
not greater than 0.0001. If this is the case, then
the numerical fields 33  and  33.00009
must be considered equal, while 33  and  33.00011
must be reported as different.

   <p>However, <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">wdiff</span></samp> can not be used
to ignore &ldquo;small&rdquo; numerical differences, since they
do not even know what a numerical difference is.

   <p>What I have been saying till now explains why
I decided to implement a new program with
the capability to &ldquo;appropriately&rdquo; compare files containing numerical
fields. 
In writing this program I was inspired by <samp><span class="command">ndiff</span></samp>,
a GPL'ed software by Nelson H. Baabe of the Salt Lake
City University. The author of <samp><span class="command">ndiff</span></samp> had the same
good reasons as me to write <samp><span class="command">ndiff</span></samp>. <samp><span class="command">ndiff</span></samp>
is actually a good tool and I used it for a while. But I did not
completely like the way it works and so <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> was
born. 
Although <samp><span class="command">ndiff</span></samp> inspired <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>, they are completely
different from the viewpoint of the source code:
<samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> has been entirely written from scratch
with the addition of code coming from GNU bc, GNU diff
and GNUlib. 
In addition, the last versions of Numdiff offer much more
features than <samp><span class="command">ndiff</span></samp> does.

   <p><samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> can be used to compare putatively similar files
line by line and field by field, ignoring small numeric differences
or/and different numeric formats. 
<samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> takes two mandatory arguments, the paths of the
two files to compare, and, after splitting them into lines
and the lines into fields
according to a given list of field delimiters, it compares
every field of every line of the first file with
the corresponding field of the second file. 
What <em>corresponding</em> here exactly means
depends on the options passed to the program on
the command line. With no options, corresponding
means the field of the second file at the same position,
where position refers both to the line number and to the
location within the line. 
If the compared fields are both legal
numerical values, then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> performs a numerical comparison
between them, else it performs a literal comparison,
i.e. the usual byte by byte comparison. 
In case of literal comparison, two fields are regarded
as equal if they are formed by the same sequence
of characters. 
In case of numerical comparison and without specific
command line options, two fields are regarded as equal
if their numerical difference is zero. 
Be careful ! If you do not explicitly
specify a list of field delimiters by the option <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp>,
then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> takes as field delimiters
the characters newline (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo;, ASCII code 0x0A),
horizontal tabulation (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>&rsquo;, ASCII code 0x09),
and blank (&lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo;, ASCII code 0x20).

   <p>For instance, if the file <samp><span class="file">list1</span></samp> contains the data
<pre class="verbatim">accident        123     23Joshua          34.55           +3+4i	        water
dog       -3455.321     cat             2.345678e-9     .0005-6.23e2i

</pre>

<p class="noindent">and file <samp><span class="file">list2</span></samp> contains the data

<pre class="verbatim">Accident        123     23456          34.5500         +3.0001+4i

<p class="noindent">then the output of the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff list1 list2</span></samp>&rsquo; will be:

     +++  File "list1" differs from file "list2"
</pre>
   <p>At the same time <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> will print the following error message
on stderr:
<pre class="example">     ***  End of file "list1" reached
          Likely the files "list1" and "list2" do not have the same number of lines !
</pre>
   <p>It is worth remarking that <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> can recognize complex numbers,
provided that they are written in the form a+bi or
a-bi with no extra characters between the values a, b and
the sign + or - (the symbol i
used to represent the imaginary unit can be actually changed by a suitable
command line option, see <a href="#Invoking-numdiff">Invoking numdiff</a>). 
If you do not know what complex numbers are, do not worry! 
In this case probably you will never manage files containing complex numbers
and so you can happily continue to ignore them. :)

   <p>Let us consider now an example which shows how Numdiff can
resynchronize the lines between two files in case of addition or deletion
of one or more lines. 
The versions of Numdiff prior to 5 did not work well if
one of the two files to compare contains
in the middle some lines more or less than the other one. 
For instance, if you have one file that is 1000 lines long that you
are comparing to a second file 1001 lines long, and except for that one
extra line, located, let us say, at line 500, the files are identical,
then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> version 4.x does <strong>not</strong> show only the one line difference:
once the files are out of synchronization <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> 4.x reports
every line as different. 
Since version 5 it is possible in such cases to activate a filter which handles
additions and deletions of lines. 
There are several options ruling how the filter
actually works and I will give later a detailed explanation
on how to use them to obtain each time the wished result. 
The simplest way to activate the filter consists in
using the option <samp><span class="option">-z @</span></samp>. 
If <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp> are given by
<pre class="verbatim"> Month          Expenses

     +++  File "bill1" differs from file "bill2"
     
</pre>
   <p>Numdiff has reported correctly the following differences:
     <ul>
<li>the second line of file <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp>, i.e. 
the one containing the separator, has no
correspondance, or, if you prefer, has been deleted
from file <samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp>. 
<li>The lines related to the months January 2009
and March have been slightly modified in
<samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp>, namely the values of the expenses
are slightly different. Notice that the line
with the expenses for January 2009 is the third one
in file <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp> and the second one in file
<samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp>. This information
is printed by Numdiff in the form
     <pre class="example">          ##3       &lt;==  Jan09          $  233.56
          ##2       ==&gt;  Jan09          $  234.00
</pre>
     <p>Analogously
     <pre class="example">          ##5       &lt;==  Mar09          $   12.55
          ##3       ==&gt;  Mar09          $   13.00
</pre>
     <p>says that the line for March is
the fifth one in <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp> and the third
one in <samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp>. 
<li>The line related to
the total amount of the expenses
appears also differently in the two files,
since the amount of the expenses is different. 
Notice that this line is the 16th one
in file <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp> and the 11th one in file
<samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp>. 
<li>The lines related to the months February,
April, June, August and October, i.e. the lines
no. 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp>, are not present
in <samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp>. 
<li>The line of <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp> with the expenses for December 2009
is replaced in <samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp> by the line containing
the value of the expenses for January 2010. 
<li>The tenth line of <samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp>, i.e. the empty line
after the separator, is not present in <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp>. 
With respect to <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp> this line represents then an addition. 
</ul>

   <p>However, if you compare <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp>
without using the option <samp><span class="option">-z @</span></samp>, the result is completely
misleading. This is the output of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -V bill1 bill2</span></samp>&rsquo;:

   <p class="noindent">and shows that the filter is doing its job in the right way,
associating the lines according to the month
and not to the line number. 
Running just the filter is extremely useful in all
situations when you are not sure if the filter is working as
you wish. 
You have indeed to instruct the filter in the right way to let
it work correctly, and this requires the use of different
options depending on the structure of the files to compare. 
Since to guess the right options can be sometime
tricky, running just the filter and see the result is
the best way to be certain that you are setting up
everything correctly. 
Later, see <a href="#Filtering">Filtering</a>, I will explain in detail
     <ul>
<li>what the filter
does behind the scenes to understand
if and how it has to resynchronize the files to compare,
<li>and how the related options affect the action
of the filter. 
</ul>

   <p>By the way, it is even possible to use <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>
without any other additional option for the filter, like
in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -f bill1 bill2</span></samp>&rsquo;, but the result is more or less
the same you would obtain by performing a byte by byte comparison
with removal of the field delimiters.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> can be followed by an argument in the form
of an integer number whose meaning will be explained
later, see <a href="#Use-of-the-option-_002df">Use of the option -f</a>.

   <p>Even if the output of <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> is self-explanatory, in the
next section I will explain in details all you have to know about it.

their positions within the line. The position in the line
is &ldquo;1&rdquo; for the first field of a line, &ldquo;2&rdquo;
for the second field, &ldquo;3&rdquo;
for the third one and so on: fields
are numerated starting from the left hand of the line
and proceeding towards the right hand. 
For each report the line number is introduced  by the symbol &ldquo;##&rdquo;,
while the field number by &ldquo;#:&rdquo;. 
Then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> shows in what the difference consists. 
For instance,
<pre class="example">     ##1       #:1   &lt;== accident
     ##1       #:1   ==&gt; Accident
     @                                                     @@
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">means that the first field of the first line is
&ldquo;accident&rdquo; in the first file, while in the
second file it appears as &ldquo;Accident&rdquo;. 
This difference could be then canceled
by removing &ldquo;accident&rdquo; from the first file
and inserting &ldquo;Accident&rdquo; in place of it. 
The arrows &ldquo;&lt;==&rdquo; and &ldquo;==&gt;&rdquo; try to
visualize this idea. 
Analogously,
<pre class="example">     ##2       #:2   &lt;== -3455.321
     ##2       #:2   ==&gt; -3455.320098
     @ Absolute error = 9.0200000000e-4, Relative error = 2.6104672633e-7
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">means that the second field of the second line
is &ldquo;-3455.321&rdquo; in the first file and
&ldquo;-3455.320098&rdquo; in the second one. 
Since the contents of the field are numerical
in both files, <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> also prints
the absolute and relative errors.

   <p>The absolute error (or absolute difference) is given by the absolute
value of the difference between the values
appearing in the two files.

   <p>The relative error (or relative difference) is actually defined
in a more complicated way. 
If <em>n1</em> is the value appearing in the first
file and <em>n2</em> is the value in the second file,
then the absolute error is given by the formula <em>A=|n1-n2|</em>,
while the relative error <em>R</em> is given by:

     <ul>
<li><em>R = 0</em> if <em>n1</em> and <em>n2</em> are equal,
<li><em>Inf</em> (infinity) if <em>n2</em> differs from <em>n1</em> and
at least one of them is zero,
<li><em>R = A/ min(|n1|, |n2|)</em> if <em>n1</em> and <em>n2</em> are
both non zero and <em>n2</em> differs from <em>n1</em>. <em>min(|n1|, |n2|)</em>
denotes the minimum between the absolute value of <em>n1</em>
and the absolute value of <em>n2</em>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">With these definitions of absolute
and relative error it turns out that <em>A(n2, n1) = A(n1, n2)</em> and
<em>R(n2, n1) = R(n1, n2)</em>. In other words, the absolute/relative error
does not change if you only change the order of the compared values. 
Since version 5 it is actually possible to let Numdiff
compute the relative error always with respect to the value
from the first file or always with respect to the value
from the second file, instead of using the preceding formula. 
This can be done through the option <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> by writing
its argument in a special form,
see <a href="#Alternative-formulas-for-the-computation-of-the-relative-difference">Alternative formulas for the computation of the relative difference</a>.

   <p>If at least one of the compared fields is not numerical, then the output line
reporting absolute and relative errors is replaced by
the separator:
<pre class="verbatim">@                                                     @@
</pre>

   <p>It can happen that a line in one of the two
files to compare contains
more fields than the corresponding line of
the other file. 
When this is the case, <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> reports this difference
by telling that a certain line (identified by its
line number) appears to be shorter than expected,
just as in
<pre class="example">     ##1       #&gt;6   &lt;== water
     ##1             ==&gt;
     @ Line 1 in file "list2" is shorter than expected!
</pre>
   <p>or in
<pre class="example">     ##3             &lt;==
     ##3       #&gt;1   ==&gt; A new line
     @ Line 3 in file "list1" is shorter than expected!
</pre>
   <p>In addition, <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> shows
the <i>tail</i> of the longer line, using the notation &ldquo;#&gt;n&rdquo;
to indicate the number n of the first field of the longer line
for which there is no corresponding field in the shorter line. 
For instance,
<pre class="example">     ##1       #&gt;6   &lt;== water
     ##1             ==&gt;
     @ Line 1 in file "list2" is shorter than expected!
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">means that for none of the fields of the first line starting from the sixth one
there exists a corresponding field in the second file (<samp><span class="file">list2</span></samp>). 
In this context, the symbol <tt>&lt;&lt;*>></tt> (when it appears) is used to denote
the End-Of-File, i.e. a line or the tail of a line which
is located at the end of the corresponding file and
does not have a terminating <em>newline</em> character.

   <p>It can also happen that one of the two
files to compare has less lines than the other one. 
In this case, if no special option is passed to the program,
<samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> prints the number of the first
line which appears in only one of the two files. 
Moreover, it prints on the standard error
a message telling in which of the two files
the end has been prematurely reached:
<pre class="example">     ***  End of file "list1" reached
          Likely the files "list1" and "list2" do not have the same number of lines !
</pre>
   <p>Unless the option <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> is used (see <a href="#Invoking-numdiff">Invoking numdiff</a>),
<samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> prints on standard output
a message reporting the final status of the comparison. 
This message says either the two files are equal
or they are different, just as in the example we are
considering:
<pre class="example">     +++  File "list1" differs from file "list2"
</pre>
   <p>The output produced just by running the filter is
a side by side difference listing of the two compared files,
like the one displayed by GNU sdiff. 
The files are listed in two columns with a gutter between them.  The
gutter contains one of the following markers:
     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">white space</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The corresponding lines are in common.  That is, either the lines
are identical, or the difference is ignored because of one of the
options <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Z</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The corresponding lines differ, and they are either both complete
or both incomplete.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The files differ and only the first file contains the line.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The files differ and only the second file contains the line.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The corresponding lines differ, and only the first line is
incomplete.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The corresponding lines differ, and only the second line is
incomplete. 
</dl>

   <p>An input line is incomplete if its last character is not a newline. 
This can happen only if the line is the last one of its file. 
When an output line of the side by side difference listing
represents two differing lines, one might be incomplete
while the other is not.  In this case the gutter is marked
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; if the line from the first file is incomplete, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;
if the line from the second file is.

   <p>Side by side format is easy to read, but it has limitations. 
It generates much wider output than usual, and truncates
lines that are too long to fit.  Also, it relies on lining up output
quite heavily, so its output looks particularly bad if you
use varying width fonts, nonstandard tab stops, or nonprinting
characters.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> can take an optional argument, which
allows to set the width of the output and eventually to suppress
common lines, see <a href="#Invoking-numdiff">Invoking numdiff</a> and <a href="#Use-of-the-option-_002df">Use of the option -f</a>.

   <p>More generally, the user can always make <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
avoid to print, partially or totally, the messages
that it would otherwise send to standard output. 
This can be achieved by some suitable command
line options, see <a href="#Invoking-numdiff">Invoking numdiff</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Installing</h2>

<p><a name="index-Install-13"></a><a name="index-Compile-14"></a><a name="index-Build-15"></a>
To successfully compile, build and install Numdiff some
tools are required. The first one is an ANSI C compiler. 
This compiler should at least accept
the option <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp>
to write its output to a specified file,
the option <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> for macros predefinition,
the option <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> to search for a specified library,
and the options <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp>
to add a given directory to the search path for include and
library files respectively.

   <p>Numdiff has been successfully compiled and tested on
Slackware&reg; GNU/Linux 10.2 with the version 3.3.6 of the GNU C Compiler (GCC),
on Slackware GNU/Linux 11 with GCC 3.4.6,
on Slackware GNU/Linux 12.2 with GCC 4.2.4,
on Slackware GNU/Linux 13 with GCC 4.3.3,
on Debian&reg; GNU/Linux 4.0 with GCC 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21),
on SunOS&reg; 5.8 with GCC 2.95.3, and on SunOS 5.10 (i386)
with the version 5.9 of the Sun C compiler.

   <p>Moreover, you need a POSIX implementation of the <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> utility
(I used both GNU make and smake by Joerg Schilling
to compile Numdiff) and a POSIX implementation
of the commands <samp><span class="command">rm</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp>. 
At last, you need a proper installation of GNU Texinfo
(in order to install the info documentation) and
a shell sh-compatible.

   <p>Configuration, building and installation of Numdiff can be
performed through the standard three steps:
<pre class="example">             ./configure
             make
             make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you leave enabled the Natural Language Support and you
also want to install the localization files (at the moment
only the Italian localization is supplied), then, after
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;, you will have to type and run
<pre class="example">             make install-nls
</pre>
   <p>By default, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; will install all the files in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/info</span></samp> etc.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> using the
option <samp><span class="option">--prefix</span></samp> in the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> step,
for instance &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--prefix=$HOME</span></samp>&rsquo;:
<pre class="example">             ./configure --prefix=$HOME
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For better control, you can use the options
<samp><span class="option">--bindir</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">--infodir</span></samp>, and so on. 
Type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">./configure --help</span></samp>&rsquo; to obtain
the complete list of all the available options.

   <p>Anyway, the documentation files, including a full User Manual
available in several formats (HTML, PDF and plain ASCII text),
will always be put in <samp><var>DOCDIR</var><span class="file">/numdiff</span></samp>,
where <var>DOCDIR</var> is the path specified by the option <samp><span class="option">--docdir</span></samp>
or, if this option has not been given to
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>, <samp><var>PREFIX</var><span class="file">/local/doc</span></samp>. 
Here <var>PREFIX</var> is the installation prefix specified by the
option <samp><span class="option">--prefix</span></samp> or the default <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>.

   <p>Once Numdiff has been installed you can remove all the
files previously installed by a simple &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make uninstall</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If you have also installed the localization files trough
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install-nls</span></samp>&rsquo;, then, in order to remove also
these ones, use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make uninstall-nls</span></samp>&rsquo; in place
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make uninstall</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Between the options accepted by <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
there are <samp><span class="option">--enable-debug</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">--enable-optimization</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">--enable-nls</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--enable-gmp</span></samp>.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">--enable-debug</span></samp> turns on debugging when
compiling the source code. This is obtained by passing to the
compiler the <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> option, but you can change this default
debugging flag (which could not even be recognized by your compiler)
by setting the environment variable <samp><span class="env">DBGFLAGS</span></samp> before
calling <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">--enable-optimization</span></samp> turns on basic optimization when
compiling the source code. This is obtained by passing to the
compiler the <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp> option, but you can change this default
flag (which could not even be recognized by your compiler)
by setting the environment variable <samp><span class="env">OPTFLAGS</span></samp> before
calling <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">--enable-nls</span></samp> turns on Natural Language Support. 
But you do not need to use it explicitly, since Natural
Language Support is enabled by default. 
However, you can disable it by using <samp><span class="option">--disable-nls</span></samp>. 
Disabling Natural Language Support is suggested whenever
you want to install Numdiff on a system where the GNU gettext library
is not present. In this case
the installation of Numdiff can be accomplished, for instance,
through
<pre class="example">             ./configure --disable-nls
             make
             make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Since version 5.2.0 Numdiff uses to perform all computations
the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
(also called GNU MP or GMP), if this library is available
at build-time. 
The old internal support for multiple precision arithmetic
is a fall-back in case GNU MP is absent. 
However it is possible to use the internal support for
multiple precision arithmetic even when GNU MP is available:
it is sufficient to pass the option <samp><span class="option">--enable-gmp=no</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">--disable-gmp</span></samp> to the  configure  script
before building the program, like in
<pre class="example">             ./configure --disable-gmp
             make
             make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Enabling the old internal support for multiple precision arithmetic
is deprecated, see <a href="#with-GNU-MP-is-better">with GNU MP is better</a>. 
The latest version of GNU MP is available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/</a>. See the GNU MP web page
at <a href="http://gmplib.org/">http://gmplib.org/</a> for up-to-date information on GNU MP.

<strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>

<pre class="example">        numdiff -h|--help|-v|--version
</pre>
   <p>or
<pre class="example">        numdiff [-s IFS][-a MAXERR][-r MAXERR][-2][-# PREC][-P][-N][-I]
        [-d C1C2][-t C1C2][-g N1N2][-p C1C2][-n C1C2][-e C1C2][-i C1C2]
        [-X 1:INT][-X 2:INT][-E][-D][-b][-V][-q][-S][-z 1:INT][-z 2:INT]

        <var>file1</var> <var>file2</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>file1</var> and <var>file2</var> are the names of the two files to compare
and INT stays for a positive integer value or for a range of integer values,
like 1-, 3-5 or -7.

   <p>In the first case <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> prints a short help (not so short actually :))
or/and version number, Copyright, License notice, NO-Warranty disclaimer and
some information about the way it was built. 
In the second case <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> compares the files specified by
the two (mandatory) arguments which follow the list of the options. 
The complete path of a file should be given, a directory name is not accepted. 
Moreover, the two arguments cannot refer to the same file
but one of them can be <tt>-</tt>, which refers to stdin.

<p class="noindent"><strong>SOME EXPLANATIONS</strong>

   <p>The options <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> are used to
hide part of the standard output of the program according
to some rule.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> triggers the &ldquo;dummy mode&rdquo;. In this mode
<samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> does not print the numerical differences. A numerical
difference occurs whenever the compared fields turn out to be both of numerical
type, but the field from the second file has a value
which differs from the one of the field from the first file. 
The &ldquo;dummy mode&rdquo; is so called since when it is active,
<samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> does not perform the job for which I created it.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp> triggers the &ldquo;essential mode&rdquo;. In this mode
<samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> only prints the numerical differences between the
two files and, if there are some, the differences in the
structure. The latter ones occur either when one of
the compared files contains a line for which there is no
corresponding line in the other file, or
when, comparing two lines, it turns out that
one of them contains a field for which there exists no
corresponding field in the other one. 
If you are not running any filter or cutting out some
fields through the option <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp>, then
the differences in the structure simply consist either
in a different number of lines in the
two files, or in a different number of fields on a line.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> triggers the &ldquo;brief mode&rdquo;. In this mode
<samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> does not print the differences in
the structure of the two files, see just above for an explanation
on what they are.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> triggers the &ldquo;quiet mode&rdquo;. When
in this mode <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> does not print anything on the
standard output. The &ldquo;quiet mode&rdquo; is useful if you only want
to know whether a couple of files are equal or not. 
This information can be obtained by looking at the exit status
of the program.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-V</span></samp> triggers the &ldquo;verbose mode&rdquo;. In this
mode <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> produces a richer report by printing an header
whenever the compared lines differ. The header shows
how and where these lines appear in the compared files. 
For instance, if the files <samp><span class="file">data1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">data2</span></samp> contain the data
<pre class="verbatim">12      33
22      44.5

   <p>You must care that the options <samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-V</span></samp>
will be overridden if <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> is also set.

   <p>The amount of additional information printed by <samp><span class="option">-V</span></samp> is
trivially influenced by the options which alter
the way <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> performs the comparisons between fields
(for instance <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-N</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-P</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-E</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-I</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp>).

   <p>In the headers printed by <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> when in &ldquo;verbose mode&rdquo;
can also appear the symbol <tt>&lt;&lt;*>></tt>. This symbol, if present,
is always located at the end of a line to mean that the line
is at the end of the corresponding file and
does not have a terminating <strong>newline</strong> character.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp> adds to the standard output of <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
a statistical report with the following information:
     <ul>
<li>the number of numeric comparisons the program has done (this quantity,
like the successive ones, is influenced by the options <samp><span class="option">-P</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-N</span></samp>) and the number of those comparisons whose outcome
is a relevant numerical difference. 
<li>the largest absolute error in the set of relevant numerical differences
and the corresponding relative error,
<li>the largest relative error in the set of relevant numerical differences
together with the corresponding absolute error,
<li>the sum and the arithmetic mean of all absolute errors,
<li>the sum and the arithmetic mean of the relevant absolute
errors,
<li>the square root of the sum of the squares of all absolute errors,
<li>the square root of the sum of the squares of the relevant
absolute errors,
<li>the quadratic mean of all absolute errors, and
<li>the quadratic mean of the relevant absolute errors. 
</ul>
   By relevant numerical differences and relevant absolute errors
I mean those ones
appearing in the output of <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> when the options
<samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> are not used. 
The information printed by <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp> is not
removed when this option is used together with <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp>.

   <p>The options <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-P</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-N</span></samp> affect the way <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
performs the comparisons between numerical values. 
Without any of these options, <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> considers two
numerical fields as equal when their difference is zero.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> can be used to order that
two numerical fields must be considered equal as long
as their absolute difference does not exceed a certain threshold,
which is specified by the argument that follows the <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> option.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> can be used to order that
two numerical fields must be considered equal as long
as their relative difference does not exceed a certain threshold,
which is specified by the argument that follows the <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> option. 
The relative difference is normally defined
in this way. 
If <em>n1</em> is a value from the file
specified as first on the command line and <em>n2</em> is the corresponding value from the second file,
then the absolute difference is given by the formula <em>A=|n1-n2|</em>. 
The relative difference <em>R</em> is given by:

     <ul>
<li><em>R = 0</em> if <em>n1</em> and <em>n2</em> are equal,
<li><em>Inf</em> (infinity) if <em>n2</em> differs from <em>n1</em> and
at least one of them is zero,
<li><em>R = A/ min(|n1|, |n2|)</em> if <em>n1</em> and <em>n2</em> are
both non zero and <em>n2</em> differs from <em>n1</em>. <em>min(|n1|, |n2|)</em>
denotes the minimum between the absolute value of <em>n1</em>
and the absolute value of <em>n2</em>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">With this definition of relative difference it turns out that
<em>R(n2, n1) = R(n1, n2)</em>: the relative difference
does not change if you only change the ordering of the compared files
on the command line.

   <p><a name="Alternative-formulas-for-the-computation-of-the-relative-difference"></a>However there are cases when this default definition of
relative error makes no sense. This can happen for instance
when one of the files is a sample file containing a list of expected data,
which could have been computed theoretically or come from experiments in a laboratory. 
In this case it is more natural to define the relative difference
as the ratio between the absolute difference and the absolute
value of the number coming from the sample file. 
If you put the prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:</span></samp>&rsquo;) in front of the
argument passed to <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp>, then Numdiff always compute
the relative difference as the ratio between the absolute difference and the absolute
value of the number from the first file (the second file, respectively). 
More precisely, with the prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:</span></samp>&rsquo;
the relative difference <em>R</em> is computed according to
these rules:
     <ul>
<li><em>R = 0</em> if <em>n1</em> and <em>n2</em> are equal,
<li><em>Inf</em> (infinity) if <em>n2</em> differs from <em>n1</em> and
<em>n1</em> is zero,
<li><em>R = |n1-n2|/ |n1|</em> if <em>n1</em> is not zero
and <em>n2</em> differs from <em>n1</em>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">With the prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:</span></samp>&rsquo;
the rules become:
     <ul>
<li><em>R = 0</em> if <em>n1</em> and <em>n2</em> are equal,
<li><em>Inf</em> (infinity) if <em>n2</em> differs from <em>n1</em> and
<em>n2</em> is zero,
<li><em>R = |n1-n2|/ |n2|</em> if <em>n2</em> is not zero
and <em>n2</em> differs from <em>n1</em>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">With the last two sets of rules is not anymore true
that <em>R(n2, n1) = R(n1, n2)</em>: the relative difference
changes, in the general case, together with the ordering of the files
on the command line.

   <p>If there is a prefix, the value after it is in any case
interpreted as tolerance threshold for the relative difference,
just as in the case when no prefix is given. 
You can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-r 1:0</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-r 2:0</span></samp>&rsquo; if you just want
to change the way the relative differences are computed
and leave the tolerance threshold to its default value,
i.e. zero.

some special characters, e.g the <strong>blank</strong>, then
you must quote it. 
I recommend you to always use the single quote character
(<tt>'</tt>) to enclose the list of the delimiters,
since in this way you will prevent
any substitution or handling of characters by the shell.

<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\f</span></samp>&rsquo;     form feed,
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo;     newline,
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\r</span></samp>&rsquo;     carriage return,
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>&rsquo;     horizontal tab,
<li>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\v</span></samp>&rsquo;     vertical tab. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The mentioned special characters are often used as delimiters
in files containing numerical data but they can not be included directly
in the set of delimiters. 
By passing the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"> \t\n,;:.</span></samp>&rsquo; as argument
for the option <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp>, one tells <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> use
as field delimiters the characters <strong>blank</strong>,
<strong>horizontal tab</strong>, <strong>newline</strong>, <strong>comma</strong>,
<strong>semicolon</strong>, <strong>colon</strong> and <strong>dot</strong>. 
Passing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"> \t\n</span></samp>&rsquo; as argument to the option <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp>
is the same as not using at all the option <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp>, since
<strong>blank</strong>, <strong>horizontal tab</strong> and <strong>newline</strong>
are the default field delimiters. 
In the list of field delimiters the character <strong>backslash</strong>
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;) is always treated in a special way. 
If followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">n</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">v</span></samp>&rsquo;
it is combined with the subsequent character and interpreted
in the way we have just seen. 
<!-- Forse questo andrebbe cambiato nel programma !!! -->
<!-- Non mi piace troppo cos come  adesso. -->
Otherwise, the <strong>backslash</strong> is coupled with
the following character and then removed. In particular,
if you want to specify the <strong>backslash</strong>
itself as field delimiter, you have to put
<strong>two backslashes</strong> (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo;) in the list of delimiters. 
Therefore, the delimiters specified by the command line

<pre class="example">     numdiff -s' \t\n\\\"' <var>file1</var> <var>file2</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">are <strong>blank</strong>, <strong>horizontal tab</strong>, <strong>newline</strong>,
<strong>backslash</strong> and <strong>double quote</strong>, since
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\"</span></samp>&rsquo; are interpreted by <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Even if I have recommended to enclose the set of
delimiters in single quotes, there are
cases in which you will be constrained to use
the double quote character (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;) to enclose
the set of field delimiters, e.g. if the single
quote character is used as field delimiter, like
in one of the precedent examples. 
However you must take into account that in this case
the shell could make some substitutions on the command line
before executing <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>. 
For instance, if your shell is GNU bash, then (citing the man page of
GNU bash)
<blockquote>
Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of
all characters within the quotes, with the exception of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">`</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">`</span></samp>&rsquo; retain their special
meaning within double quotes. 
The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of
the following characters: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">`</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;, or <strong>&lt;newline&gt;</strong>. 
A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding
it with a backslash <small class="enddots">...</small>
The special parameters * and @ have special meaning when in double quotes
<small class="dots">...</small>

   </blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Therefore, if the set of delimiters is formed by &lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; and you decide to enclose them
in double quotes, then the <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> command line should be

<pre class="example">     numdiff -s'' \t\n\\\\\"'' <var>file1</var> <var>file2</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and not

<pre class="example">     numdiff -s'' \t\n\\\"'' <var>file1</var> <var>file2</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this last case the shell would indeed replace the string

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"> \t\n\\\"</span></samp>&rsquo;

<p class="noindent">by

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"> \t\n\"</span></samp>&rsquo;

<p class="noindent">and then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> would take &lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; as field delimiters.

   <p><samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> requires the presence of the <strong>newline</strong>
in the set of characters passed to <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp>. The absence
of the <strong>newline</strong> in the set of delimiters causes the issue
of a suitable warning message and the termination of the program.

   <p>If you are running Numdiff on MSDog/MSWindoze
I recommend you to always put the <strong>carriage return</strong>
in the set of field delimiters. 
Otherwise, this character would be included in all the fields
which stay at the end of a line and this would cause some
undesirable effects. For instance, a number put at the
end of a line would not be considered as a numerical field
by <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>, since <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> would consider
the final <strong>carriage return</strong> as part of the field which then
would be qualified as non-numerical.

   <p>You can specify different delimiters for the two files to compare
by putting the prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:</span></samp>&rsquo; in front of the
set of characters passed to <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp>. 
If the argument of <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp> begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
characters after this prefix are used as field delimiters
only for the file passed as first on the command line. 
Analogously, if the prefix is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the
characters after it are used as field delimiters only
for the file specified as second on the command line. 
You can also provide an explicit set of
delimiters for just one of the files to compare,
in which case <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> uses the default field
delimiters <strong>blank</strong>, <strong>tab</strong> and <strong>newline</strong>
for the other file. 
Therefore, with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -s '1:: \n' </span><var>file1</var> <var>file2</var></samp>&rsquo;
the program will take <strong>colon</strong>, <strong>blank</strong>
and <strong>newline</strong> as delimiters for <var>file1</var>,
and <strong>blank</strong>, <strong>tab</strong> and
<strong>newline</strong> as delimiters for <var>file2</var>. 
The recommendations about quoting the set of delimiters
are valid even in presence of a prefix.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-#</span></samp> lets the user specify the number of digits
in the significands used in multiple precision arithmetic. 
The default value is 35, the largest admissible value is 180. 
If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> has been linked against the
GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (also called GNU MP),
then the precision it uses is typically higher
than the specified one. On my machine the actual value
of the precision is 20 if the user gives a value between 0 and 20,
30 if the user specifies a precision between 21 and 30,
40 for a user-specified value between 31 and 40, and so on. 
Anyway, the actual precision is never less than
the one required by the user.

<p class="noindent">Take into account that an higher precision makes the
execution of <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> slower. This is particularly
true if <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> is not using the computational routines
from the GNU MP library and the files to compare contain a lot of numerical fields. 
In addition, you have to care that <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> truncates
the value of a numerical field if it has <i>too much</i> digits with respect
to the current precision. To be precise, denoted by
<var>P</var> the current value of the precision, the following
rules apply.
     <ul>
<li>If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> has been built with
its own internal support for multiple precision arithmetic, then
          <ul>
<li>if a number is written in ordinary decimal notation, <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
will consider, in addition to all digits of the integer part, only
the first <var>P</var> digits of the fractional part;
<li>if a value is written in scientific notation, then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
will only consider the first <var>P</var> digits of the fractional part
of the mantissa. 
</ul>
     <li>If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> uses the routines from the GNU MP library
to perform its computations, the value of a numerical
field is first translated into scientific notation and then
only the first <var>P</var> digits of the fractional part
of the mantissa are considered. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">You can find out whether your local version of <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
is relying on GNU MP or not by executing the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -v</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> uses GNU MP, then this command will display
the following message or similar (possibly translated
into your mother language) among other information:
<pre class="example">     The software has been linked against
     the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library,
     version number 4.2.4.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> does not rely on GNU MP, then
the displayed message will be (up to translation into
your mother language)
<pre class="example">     The software has been built with
     its own internal support for multiple precision arithmetic.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The options <samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp> can be used
to instruct <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> about the numeric formats used in the
files which it is going to compare. 
The two files to compare do not have to adopt the same numeric format
and then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> allows to specify different numeric
formats for them. 
Each of the options <samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp>
can have as argument one or two characters (one or two digits if the
option is <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>). In the first case
the argument refers to both files to compare, in the second case
the first character is for the file specified as
first on the command line, the second character for
the file specified as last. 
For instance, the option <samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp> can be used to
tell <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> which character(s) is(are)
used to mean the decimal point in the two files to compare. 
If you give the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -d_ </span><var>file1</var> <var>file2</var></samp>&rsquo;,
then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> will understand that both in <var>file1</var> and in <var>file2</var>
the character <strong>underscore</strong> (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;) is used in place
of the default one (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;) to indicate
the position of the decimal point in the numerical values. 
But if the command is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -d_: </span><var>file1</var> <var>file2</var></samp>&rsquo;,
then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> will understand that the decimal point
is indicated by the character <strong>underscore</strong> in <var>file1</var>,
and by <strong>colon</strong> (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;) in <var>file2</var>.

   <p>If you omit to use one of the options
<samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp>, then the corresponding
attribute will take its default value, see <a href="#Default-Numeric-Format">Default Numeric Format</a>.

   <p>You must be really careful when you use one or more
of these options. 
First, not all characters can be passed to them as arguments. 
The arguments of the option <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>
must be digits,
the arguments of the options <samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp> must
be punctuation marks (punctuation marks are all the
characters of the ASCII set for which the standard C function
<code>ispunct</code> returns a non zero value), those ones
of the options <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp>
must be graphical characters but digits (graphical characters
are all the characters of the ASCII set for which the standard C function
<code>isgraph</code> returns a non zero value).

   <p>It is not possible to set
the decimal point, the thousands separator,
the positive sign, the negative sign, the
prefix for decimal exponent or the
symbol of the imaginary unit so that, for a same file,
two or more of these characters come out to be equal. 
This rule also applies when you miss to explicitly select
a symbol through the appropriate option. 
For instance, the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -d,. </span><var>file1</var> <var>file2</var></samp>&rsquo;
will make <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> abnormally terminate after printing
the error message:

<pre class="example">     The numeric format specified for the first file is illegal,
     the following symbols should be all different
     while two or more of them are actually equal:
     
     Decimal point = `,'
     Thousands separator = `,'
     Leading positive sign = `+'
     Leading negative sign = `-'
     Prefix for decimal exponent = `e'
     Symbol used to denote the imaginary unit = `i'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Through the option <samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp> we have told to <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
that in the first file the decimal point is indicated by the character
<strong>comma</strong>, but at the same time we have not modified the character
in use to separate the groups of thousands, which has remained the
default one, i.e. <strong>comma</strong>, for both files to compare. 
In this way, we have implicitly told to <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> that in
<var>file1</var> the character <strong>comma</strong> represents both decimal point
and thousands separator. Since this is not reasonable, <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
refuses to work. 
To avoid this problem it would be sufficient to
explicitly notify to <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> the thousands separator
through the option <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp>:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -d,. -t., </span><var>file1</var> <var>file2</var></samp>&rsquo;. 
Of course, here we are supposing that the decimal point
and the thousands separator are represented in <var>file1</var>
by <strong>comma</strong> and <strong>dot</strong> respectively, in
<var>file2</var> by <strong>dot</strong> and <strong>comma</strong>. 
I strongly suggest you that in writing a file you
avoid the use of the same symbol
to mean two different things (like would be using
<strong>comma</strong> for both decimal point and thousands
separator), it is nonsense.

   <p>At last, it is possible (but stupid) to use
as argument for the options <samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp>
one of the characters used to separate the fields in
the files to compare. 
In such a case <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> does not complain but you have
to consider that it uses first the set of field delimiters
in order to split the files into fields and then, when it has to distinguish
between numerical and non-numerical fields, it takes
into account the numeric formats specified for the two files. 
However, it should never happen to specify as argument for one of
the options <samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-i</span></samp> a character
which is also used as field delimiter: again, in writing a file you
should avoid (and people usually avoid it)
to use the same symbol to mean two different things.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp> can be used
to restrict the comparison between files to a certain
group of fields. 
<a name="Use-of-the-option-_002dX"></a>This option requires as argument a range of positive integer values
or eventually just one positive integer number. The argument specifies
the position(s) of the fields that <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
has to ignore. 
Remember that the fields of a line are numerated starting
from the left hand of the line
and proceeding towards the right hand.

   <p>The argument passed to <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp> can start with a prefix,
which must be either &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:</span></samp>&rsquo; refers to the file passed as first on the command line,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:</span></samp>&rsquo; to the file specified as second. 
With the prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:</span></samp>&rsquo; only the fields of the first file
corresponding to the given position(s) are ignored. 
Similarly, if you want to ignore only fields from the
second file you have to use the prefix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp> can appear more times on the command line,
in which case <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> will ignore all fields
located in the positions so specified. 
Some examples can clarify the use of ranges and prefixes. 
If the file <samp><span class="file">List1</span></samp> contains the data
<pre class="verbatim">* a  1    1     1     1
* b  2    2     2     2
* c  3    3     3     3
* d  4    4     4     4

<p class="noindent">and <samp><span class="file">List2</span></samp> the data

     +++  File "List1" differs from file "List2"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Numdiff cuts off from <samp><span class="file">List1</span></samp>
the fields in the positions 1, 2 and 6
and from <samp><span class="file">List2</span></samp> the fields in the positions
4, 5 and 6. 
In this way it compares the third, fourth and fifth field
of every line of
<samp><span class="file">List1</span></samp> with the first, second and third field respectively
of the corresponding line of <samp><span class="file">List2</span></samp>. 
An equivalent form of the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -X 1:1-2 -X 2:4 -X 1:6 -X 2:5-6 List1 List2</span></samp>&rsquo;
is given by
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -X 1:1-2 -X 2:4-5 -X 6 List1 List2</span></samp>&rsquo; :
since the sixth field is cut off from both files we can
refer to it without a prefix.

   <p>As you can see, you can specify a range of fields
by using the notation &lsquo;<samp><var>m</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;,
where <var>m</var> and <var>n</var> are the field numbers
of the first and of the last field in the range. 
It is even possible to use range expressions like
&lsquo;<samp><var>m</var><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;. The first
expression corresponds to all fields starting from
the <var>m</var>th one (inclusive) till to the end of line,
the second selects all fields from the first one
till to the <var>n</var>th one (inclusive). 
Therefore the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -X 1:1-2 -X 2:4 -X 1:6 -X 2:5-6 List1 List2</span></samp>&rsquo;
is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -X 1:-2 -X 2:4 -X 1:6 -X 2:5- List1 List2</span></samp>&rsquo;
or to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -X 1:-2 -X 1:6 -X 2:4- List1 List2</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Care that the largest field number that you can
use while writing a specification for the option <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp> is
32768.

   <p>If you use the option <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp> the exit status of <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
reflects the outcome of the restricted comparison. 
For instance, the exit status of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -X 8- </span><var>file1</var> <var>file2</var></samp>&rsquo;
is 1 only if <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> has found a difference
in the first seven fields of <var>file1</var> and <var>file2</var>. 
If the two files differ only in the fields after the seventh one,
then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> ends with a zero exit status.

   <p>Going back to the example with <samp><span class="file">List1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">List2</span></samp>,
the output of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -X 1:1-2 -X 1:4- -X 2:2- List1 List2</span></samp>&rsquo; is
<pre class="example">     
     +++  Files "List1" and "List2" are equal
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">since every field of <samp><span class="file">List1</span></samp> at position 3 is equal
to the first field in the corresponding line of <samp><span class="file">List2</span></samp>. 
The exit code returned by the program to the shell
is zero.

   <p>The options <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Z</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-H</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-T</span></samp> influence the action of the filter
and their use is then described later, <a href="#Filtering">Filtering</a>. 
Care that <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Z</span></samp> require both an argument in the same
form requested by <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp>.

   <p>Since version 5 Numdiff accepts also long options to conform to
the GNU standards. Now it is then possible, e.g., to use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--separator='\n\t %'</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--separator '\n\t %'</span></samp>&rsquo;
instead of using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-s '\n\t %'</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The long options, which start all with two dashes,
are listed at the beginning of this chapter, each one near to
the corresponding short option.

   <p>The argument of a long option may or may not preceded
by the <tt>=</tt> sign. The only exception is the option
<samp><span class="option">--test-filter</span></samp>, for which the presence of the <tt>=</tt>
before the argument is mandatory. 
Then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--test-filter=60</span></samp>&rsquo; is correct while
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--test-filter 60</span></samp>&rsquo; is not accepted.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Selecting lines for the comparison</h2>

<p><a name="index-ndselect-_0028introduction-to-its-use_0029-22"></a><a name="index-Tools-23"></a>
Together with the version 5.x of Numdiff is shipped a
useful tool, the program <samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp>. I decided to
create this utility in order to deal with a situation that comes out
often in Numerical Analysis. Here I present a very simple example of
such a situation. Let us suppose that file <samp><span class="file">list1</span></samp>
contains the values of the square root, rounded to the 20th decimal digit,
for all the integer numbers between 10 and 20:
<pre class="verbatim">12       3.46410161513775458705
13       3.60555127546398929312
14       3.74165738677394138558
15       3.87298334620741688518
16       4
17       4.12310562561766054982
18       4.24264068711928514641
19       4.35889894354067355224
20       4.47213595499957939282
21       4.58257569495584000659
22       4.69041575982342955457
23       4.7958315233127195416
24       4.89897948556635619639
</pre>

<p class="noindent">while <var>list2</var> contains <em>suitable</em> approximations of the square root
only for the numbers between 12 and 21 which are multiple of 3:

<pre class="verbatim">12       3.46410162002945508100
15       3.87298387096774193548
18       4.24264705882352941176
21       4.58260869565217391304
</pre>

<p class="noindent">These approximations could have been obtained for instance
by using the famous Heron's algorithm, which, given an approximation
<code>a</code> for the square root of a number <code>x</code>, computes a better
approximation by the formula <code>a := 0.5 * (x/a + a)</code>. 
What we want now is to understand by using <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
how good are the approximations
contained in file <var>list2</var>. Unfortunately,
we cannot execute directly the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff list1 list2</span></samp>&rsquo;,
since in this way we would compare the approximations provided for
the square roots of 15, 18, and 21 with the square roots of
13, 14, and 15 respectively. To make the comparison in the right way,
one could open <samp><span class="file">list1</span></samp> in a text editor and remove from this file
all the non interesting lines till to leave only the ones
related to the numbers 12, 15, 18, and 21. But this approach
is practicable because we have to remove few lines, and one can
easily figure out how boring and inefficient would be to manually
remove hundreds or thousands of lines from a file in order to
compare it with another one.

   <p>An expert GNU user would suggest that it is
possible to make this removal automatic by using the well known utilities
<samp><span class="command">head</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>, in this particular case
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">head -n 10 list1 | sed -n -e '1~3 p' &gt; List1</span></samp>&rsquo;
A quick explanation for the ones who do not know how to use <samp><span class="command">head</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>: the previous command extracts from
<samp><span class="file">list1</span></samp> the first 10 lines, namely the ones containing the square roots
of the numbers from 12 to 21, then picks every third line starting
from the first one between the extracted lines, in order to select only
the ones related to 12, 15, 18, and 21. Finally, these lines are printed
on the file <samp><span class="file">List1</span></samp>, which then looks like:
<pre class="verbatim">12       3.46410161513775458705
15       3.87298334620741688518
18       4.24264068711928514641
21       4.58257569495584000659
</pre>

   <p>Once obtained <samp><span class="file">List1</span></samp>, we can perform with <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
the comparison between the values we are interested in:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff List1 list2</span></samp>&rsquo; . 
Unfortunately, this trick only works if you have installed the GNU version
of <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp>, which, as far as I know, is the only one to
provide the extension <var>first~step</var> to specify line addresses. 
That is way I decided to implement <samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp>, which allows to
obtain the same result as before with the simpler command:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ndselect -b 1 -e 10 -s 3 list1 &gt; List1</span></samp>&rsquo;

   <p>The meaning of the arguments passed to the options <samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp> is the following: we are telling
<samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp> to print every third line of file <samp><span class="file">list1</span></samp>
(the option <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp> specifies the step),
starting from the first one (the option <samp><span class="option">-b</span></samp> specifies the beginning)
and ending within the tenth one possibly inclusive
(the option <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> specifies the end). 
Because of the presence of the redirection operator <code>&gt;</code>,
the previous command sends to the file <samp><span class="file">List1</span></samp>
what <samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp> would print on the screen (standard output).

   <p>Using <samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp> is very simple and elegant, other than
extremely useful in the situations just outlined. A complete description
of its use follows.

<strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>

<pre class="example">        ndselect -h|--help|-v|--version
</pre>
   <p>or
<pre class="example">        ndselect [-b FIRST][-e LAST][-s STEP][-l PATH][-o PATH] [<var>file</var>]
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>file</var> is the name of the file to scan.

   <p>In the first case <samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp> prints a
short help or/and version number, Copyright, License notice
and NO-Warranty disclaimer. 
In the second case <samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp> prints on the standard output
every STEPth line of <var>file</var> starting with line FIRST
and ending within line LAST. 
The complete path of <var>file</var> should be given,
a directory name is not accepted. 
If no input file is specified, the program reads
from the standard input.

<p class="noindent"><strong>OPTIONS</strong>

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">-b, --beginning, --start=FIRST</span></samp><dd>Specify the first line to print
(The default behavior is to start with line number 1)

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-e, --end=LAST</span></samp><dd>Specify the last line that can be printed
(The default behavior is to arrive till to the end of the file)

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-s, --step=STEP</span></samp><dd>Specify the step to use when selecting
the lines to print (The default value for the step is 1)

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-l, --warnings-to=PATH</span></samp><dd>Redirect warning and error messages from stderr
to the indicated file

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-o, --output=PATH</span></samp><dd>Redirect output from stdout to the indicated file

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-h, --help</span></samp><dd>Show the help message

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">-v, --version</span></samp><dd>Show version number, Copyright, Distribution Terms and NO-Warranty
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Passing 0 as argument to the option <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> is equivalent
to omit this option and leave enabled the default behavior
(which consists in scanning till to the end of the file).

<p class="noindent"><strong>DIAGNOSTICS</strong>

   <p>The exit status is 0 in case of normal termination,
-1 (255) in case of error.

<p class="noindent">As <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> does, also <samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp> since version 5
accepts long options. So instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ndselect -b 1 -e 10 -s 3 list1 &gt; List1</span></samp>&rsquo;,
you can launch this command as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ndselect --start=1 --end=10 --step=3 list1 &gt; List1</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Using the filter of numdiff</h2>

<p><a name="index-Filter-29"></a>
Since version 5 it is possible
to activate a filter when calling <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>,
so that the program performs automatically the
comparison in the desired way. 
Recalling the example of chapter 6,
if you run the command <samp><span class="command">numdiff -z 2- -V list1 list2</span></samp>
you obtain the following result:

by likening each line of <samp><span class="file">list2</span></samp>

The output obtained running

</pre>
   <p>If you compare the command
<samp><span class="command">numdiff -z 2- -V list1 list2</span></samp> with the one
used here, see <a href="#command">command</a>, for the files <samp><span class="file">bill1</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">bill2</span></samp> you surely notice that the filter
has been invoked in different ways, first
with <samp><span class="option">-z @</span></samp> and then with <samp><span class="option">-z 2-</span></samp>.

   <p>The <i>synchronization</i> procedure used by the filter
is based on <i>blurring</i> and byte by byte comparison. 
The options <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Z</span></samp> are used
to select which field(s) from which file have to
be blurred. They take both an argument in the
same form requested by <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp>, see <a href="#Use-of-the-option-_002dX">Use of the option -X</a>,
but accept additionally the special value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;
as abbreviation for the range of fields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1-</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Then the specifications &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1:@</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">2:@</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;
are used to mean all fields of the first file,
of the second one or of both, respectively.

   <p>Employing <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Z</span></samp> in the right way
is extremely important to let the filter work as desired. 
For instance, <samp><span class="command">numdiff -f -z @ list1 list2</span></samp>
matches the lines of <samp><span class="file">list1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">list2</span></samp>
in the same wrong way

   <p class="noindent">as Numdiff would do without triggering the filter at all.

   <p>It is essential then to understand what <i>blurring a field</i> means
and how the filter uses blurring to match the lines
of the files to compare.

   <p>After reading the files the filter removes from each of them
(from their images in the memory, actually)
all the fields selected by the option
<samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp>, then it replaces each of the fields that
have to be blurred by a special character. 
This special character is the same for both files
and it is so chosen that it cannot appear in
the text. Blurring a field means to replace
it by this sort of <i>place card</i>.

   <p>After doing this, the filter converts all remaining numerical
fields to a standard format and compares
the files byte by byte neglecting the field
delimiters. 
This comparison is just used to establish which
lines of the first file are not present in the second,
which lines of the second file are missing in the first one
and how to match the remaining lines to create
a one-to-one correspondence.

   <p>Only at this point <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> inspects
each couple of corresponding lines, splits the
two lines into the constituent fields, and
neglecting those ones eventually specified
through the option <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp> compares corresponding
fields as it is supposed to do, performing
a numerical comparison whenever the fields
are both legal numerical values.

   <p>Blurring the right fields is essential to
match the lines from the two files appropriately before
doing any numerical comparison. 
Without blurring, the numerical fields
could prevent <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> from an
appropriate matching of the lines,
in case some of them are present
in only one file, by creating confusion
with their (maybe small) numeric differences.

   <p>Blurring can be of two types, conditional
or unconditional. 
The blurring is conditional if it has
to be performed only for fields which turn out
to be legal numerical values. 
The arguments of the option <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> indicate which
fields of which file have to be blurred <strong>under the condition that
they are recognized as numeric fields</strong>. Non-numeric fields
are left by <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> untouched (no blurring occurs for them). 
Then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-z 1:5-7</span></samp>&rsquo; makes the filter blur the 5th, 6th and 7th field of each
line of the first file whenever they are recognized as numerical.

   <p>By the option <samp><span class="option">-Z</span></samp> you can specify which
fields have to be unconditionally blurred, i.e. 
independently of their type, numerical or not. 
Then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Z 2:3-4</span></samp>&rsquo; activates the blurring of the 3th and 4th field of each
line of the second file.

   <p>Going back to the comparison of the files <samp><span class="file">list1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">list2</span></samp>,
the option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-z 2-</span></samp>&rsquo; of the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -z 2- -V list1 list2</span></samp>&rsquo;
makes the filter transform the (memory copies of the)
two files as

   <p class="noindent">Since the second field is a numerical value in all the lines

&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -f -z @ list1 list2</span></samp>&rsquo; gives a wrong result. 
Since also the first field is always given by a numerical value,
the option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-z @</span></samp>&rsquo; makes the filter transform the two

   <p>Using the unconditional blurring is suggested in all cases
when a certain field, which you want to include
in the comparison (use <samp><span class="option">-X</span></samp> to completely
neglect one or more fields), is of numeric type
in almost all lines of (one of) the given
files. This can be the case e.g. when in some
lines the content of the field is given by
a special numeric value, like <tt>Infinity</tt>, <tt>Inf</tt>,
<tt>+Inf</tt> or <tt>-Inf</tt>,
or by <tt>NaN</tt>, abbreviation for <i>Not a Number</i>.

   <p>Concerning the numerical fields which are not blurred,
one has to remark, that the filter is not confused by differences in the
numeric format. Before the byte by byte comparison,
numeric values are converted indeed to a standard
format. To offer an example of this,
let us suppose that <samp><span class="file">short1</span></samp> contains a list

     +++  Files "Scnot1" and "Scnot2" have the same structure
</pre>
   <p>Till now we have always used the option <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>
with no argument. 
<a name="Use-of-the-option-_002df"></a>However <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> accepts an optional argument,
which can be used to
control how <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> displays its output. 
If you provide an argument, care not to leave any space
between the option and the argument. 
So &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f60</span></samp>&rsquo; is correct while &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f 60</span></samp>&rsquo;
makes Numdiff terminate after printing an error message.

   <p>If the argument is a positive number <var>NUM</var>, then
the side by side output produced by <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>
will be <var>NUM</var> columns wide. The default value
for the width of the output is 130, which can fit onto a
traditional printer line, and is the one used
when <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> has no argument or the supplied argument is zero. 
In other words, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f0</span></samp>&rsquo; are just easier to remind
versions of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-f130</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>A negative number as argument for <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> has the same
effect as the positive number with the same absolute value,
but in addition it causes the suppression of
common lines from the output. 
For instance the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -z 1:2 -Z 2:2 -f-130 Table1 Table2</span></samp>&rsquo;
displays the following text
<pre class="example">     -5       2.236068            &lt;

   <p>In conjunction with the option <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> you can use
<samp><span class="option">-T</span></samp> to expand tabs to spaces in the output
produced by <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>. This is useful to preserve the
alignment of tabs in the input files, if it is
thrown off by the presence of the gutter.

   <p>The options <samp><span class="option">-H</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp> affect the
performance of the filter of Numdiff. 
But performance has more than one dimension and
these options improve one aspect of performance at
the cost of another, or they improve performance in some cases while
hurting it in others.

   <p>The way that the filter re-synchronizes two files to compare always
comes up with a near-minimal set of deletions/insertions of lines. 
Usually it is good enough for practical purposes. 
If the filter displays a large set of line deletions/insertions, you
might want it to use a modified algorithm that sometimes produces a
smaller set of differences.  The <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp> option does this;
however, it can also cause the filter to run more slowly than usual,
so it is not the default behavior.

   <p>When the files you are comparing are large and have small groups of
changes scattered throughout them, you can use the
<samp><span class="option">-H</span></samp> option to make a different modification to the
algorithm that the filter uses.  If the input files have a constant small
density of changes, where change means deletion/insertion of lines,
this option speeds up the comparisons without
changing the output or in the worst case with minor modifications.

   <p>To conclude, Numdiff is not perfect but if you play with its
options and with <samp><span class="command">ndselect</span></samp> you can do a lot of nice and
difficult things, which before just the human eye could do.

This is what I obtained on my laptop, equipped with a dual core processor @1.50 GHz
and with 1GB of RAM, when I tried to compare
the numbers 1.101e1000000000 and 1.0e1000000000:
     <pre class="example">          numdiff: Insufficient memory for new allocation,
          the execution of the program ends now
</pre>
     <p>In addition, you can overload the processor with numbers
whose exponents lie outside the range -1000000, <small class="dots">...</small>, 1000000. 
But at least on my machine, everything works fine and quick enough
as long as exponent and size of the mantissa of the numbers
are in the range -1000, <small class="dots">...</small>, 1000. 
Be careful and remember that Numdiff is distributed
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

     <p>Consider also that, if you have numerical data with exponents
outside the range -300, <small class="dots">...</small>, 300, probably there is something
wrong with your data: either you are using the wrong scale,
or you should replace very small numbers, like 1e-100, by zero,
or it is quite likely that the machine/program/algorithm which
produced these data is not working right :D

     <li>If Numdiff has been linked against the
GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (also called GNU MP),
then the precision it uses is typically higher
than the specified one. On my machine the actual value
of the precision is 20 if the user gives a value between 0 and 20,
30 if the user specifies a precision between 21 and 30,
40 for a user-specified value between 31 and 40, and so on. 
Anyway, the actual precision is never less than
the one required by the user.

     <li>After reading a numerical field, Numdiff truncates its value
if this number has <i>too much</i> digits with respect
to the current precision. 
To be precise, denoted by
<var>P</var> the current value of the precision, the following
rules apply.

     <p>If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> has been built with
its own internal support for multiple precision arithmetic, then
          <ul>
<li>if the number is written in ordinary decimal notation, <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
will consider, in addition to all digits of the integer part, only
the first <var>P</var> digits of the fractional part;
<li>if the value is written in scientific notation, then <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
will only consider the first <var>P</var> digits of the fractional part
of the mantissa. 
</ul>

     <p>If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> uses the GNU MP library
to perform its computations, the value of a numerical
field is first translated into scientific notation and then
only the first <var>P</var> digits of the fractional part
of the mantissa are considered.

     <p>By current value of the precision I mean the integer value
specified by the option <samp><span class="option">-#</span></samp>, or the default one (35)
when this option is not in use.

     <li>You can find out whether your local version of <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
is relying on GNU MP or not by executing the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numdiff -v</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> uses GNU MP, then this command will display
the following message or similar (possibly translated
into your mother language) among other information:
     <pre class="example">          The software has been linked against
          the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library,
          version number 4.2.4.
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">If <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp> does not rely on GNU MP, then
the displayed message will be (up to translation into
your mother language)
     <pre class="example">          The software has been built with
          its own internal support for multiple precision arithmetic.
</pre>
     <li>Numdiff manages perfectly only text files with an
8-bit encoding (ASCII and ISO 8859-* text files). 
The use of Numdiff with UTF-8 text files suffers from some restrictions
(numbers and field delimiters must consist of ASCII characters, i.e. 
characters with the most significant bit equal to 0).

     <li>If you are not including the so called white-space characters
(usually &lsquo;<samp> </samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\t</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\v</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\r</span></samp>&rsquo;)
in the set of field delimiters, then a real and an imaginary number
which are separated just by white-spaces can be coupled together
and considered as a whole complex number. 
For example, if you are using only <strong>colon</strong> (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;) and
<strong>newline</strong> as field delimiters and Numdiff finds a line
like that
<pre class="verbatim">     ::::3.0-5.6e-356i::::-12.9   +4.34i::::-12.9    4.34i::::New York::::
</pre>

     <p class="noindent">then it will consider this line as formed by four fields, the first two
are numerical and given by the complex numbers <i>3.0-5.6e-356i</i> and
<i>-12.9+4.34i</i>, the last two ones are the strings <tt>New York</tt>
and <tt>-12.9    4.34i</tt>. 
I still do not know if I will modify this in the next version
of Numdiff, so that the program recognizes only <tt>3.0-5.6e-356i</tt>
as numerical field and treats <tt>-12.9   +4.34i</tt> as non-numerical
because of the presence of spaces in the middle. 
<tt>-12.9    4.34i</tt> is already considered as non-numerical
due to the absence of a leading sign in the imaginary value.

     <li>We have seen that one of the two files passed to <samp><span class="command">numdiff</span></samp>
can be <tt>-</tt>, which refers to stdin (standard input). In this way one of
the two files to compare can be the output produced by another
command, like in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cat file2 | numdiff -a 1.0e-3 file1 -</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
However, if you trigger the filter through the options <samp><span class="option">-z</span></samp> or/and
<samp><span class="option">-Z</span></samp>, Numdiff can not work with the standard input unless you
use also the option <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp>. So the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cat file2 | numdiff -a 1.0e-3 -z @ file1 -</span></samp>&rsquo;
displays only the error message
<pre class="verbatim">     numdiff: -: Illegal seek
</pre>
(or maybe the translation of this message in the language
 you are using on your computer)
but &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cat file2 | numdiff -a 1.0e-3 -z @ -f file1 -</span></samp>&rsquo;
works as expected.

     <li>This manual describes the version 5.x of Numdiff. 
Versions 4.0.0 and 3.x used even a different format for the output.

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
