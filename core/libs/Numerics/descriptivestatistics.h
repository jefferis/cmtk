Calculation of the distribution moments: mean, variance, slewness, kurtosis.

Input parameters:
    X       -   sample. Array with whose indexes range within [0..N-1]
    N       -   sample size.
    
Output parameters:
    Mean    -   mean.
    Variance-   variance.
    Skewness-   skewness (if variance<>0; zero otherwise).
    Kurtosis-   kurtosis (if variance<>0; zero otherwise).
