Cholesky decomposition

The algorithm computes Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric
positive-definite matrix.

The result of an algorithm is a representation of matrix A as A = U'*U or
A = L*L'.

Input parameters:
    A       -   upper or lower triangle of a factorized matrix.
                array with elements [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N       -   size of matrix A.
    IsUpper -   if IsUpper=True, then A contains an upper triangle of
                a symmetric matrix, otherwise A contains a lower one.

Output parameters:
    A       -   the result of factorization. If IsUpper=True, then
                the upper triangle contains matrix U, so that A = U'*U,
                and the elements below the main diagonal are not modified.
                Similarly, if IsUpper = False.

Result:
    If the matrix is positive-definite, the function returns True.
    Otherwise, the function returns False. This means that the
    factorization could not be carried out.
