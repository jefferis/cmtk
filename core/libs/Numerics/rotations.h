/*************************************************************************
Application of a sequence of  elementary rotations to a matrix

The algorithm pre-multiplies the matrix by a sequence of rotation
transformations which is given by arrays C and S. Depending on the value
of the IsForward parameter either 1 and 2, 3 and 4 and so on (if IsForward=true)
rows are rotated, or the rows N and N-1, N-2 and N-3 and so on, are rotated.

Not the whole matrix but only a part of it is transformed (rows from M1 to
M2, columns from N1 to N2). Only the elements of this submatrix are changed.

Input parameters:
    IsForward   -   the sequence of the rotation application.
    M1,M2       -   the range of rows to be transformed.
    N1, N2      -   the range of columns to be transformed.
    C,S         -   transformation coefficients.
                    Array whose index ranges within [1..M2-M1].
    A           -   processed matrix.
    WORK        -   working array whose index ranges within [N1..N2].

Output parameters:
    A           -   transformed matrix.

Utility subroutine.
