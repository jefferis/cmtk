LQ decomposition of a rectangular matrix of size MxN

Input parameters:
    A   -   matrix A whose indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..N-1].
    M   -   number of rows in matrix A.
    N   -   number of columns in matrix A.

Output parameters:
    A   -   matrices L and Q in compact form (see below)
    Tau -   array of scalar factors which are used to form
            matrix Q. Array whose index ranges within [0..Min(M,N)-1].

Matrix A is represented as A = LQ, where Q is an orthogonal matrix of size
MxM, L - lower triangular (or lower trapezoid) matrix of size M x N.

The elements of matrix L are located on and below  the  main  diagonal  of
matrix A. The elements which are located in Tau array and above  the  main
diagonal of matrix A are used to form matrix Q as follows:

Matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflections

Q = H(k-1)*H(k-2)*...*H(1)*H(0),

where k = min(m,n), and each H(i) is of the form

H(i) = 1 - tau * v * (v^T)

where tau is a scalar stored in Tau[I]; v - real vector, so that v(0:i-1)=0,
v(i) = 1, v(i+1:n-1) stored in A(i,i+1:n-1).
