/*************************************************************************
Reduction of a symmetric matrix which is given by its higher or lower
triangular part to a tridiagonal matrix using orthogonal similarity
transformation: Q'*A*Q=T.

Input parameters:
    A       -   matrix to be transformed
                array with elements [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N       -   size of matrix A.
    IsUpper -   storage format. If IsUpper = True, then matrix A is given
                by its upper triangle, and the lower triangle is not used
                and not modified by the algorithm, and vice versa
                if IsUpper = False.

Output parameters:
    A       -   matrices T and Q in  compact form (see lower)
    Tau     -   array of factors which are forming matrices H(i)
                array with elements [0..N-2].
    D       -   main diagonal of symmetric matrix T.
                array with elements [0..N-1].
    E       -   secondary diagonal of symmetric matrix T.
                array with elements [0..N-2].


  If IsUpper=True, the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(n-2) . . . H(2) H(0).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(i+1:n-1) = 0, v(i) = 1, v(0:i-1) is stored on exit in
  A(0:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).

  If IsUpper=False, the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(0) H(2) . . . H(n-2).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(0:i) = 0, v(i+1) = 1, v(i+2:n-1) is stored on exit in A(i+2:n-1,i),
  and tau in TAU(i).

  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
  with n = 5:

  if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':

    (  d   e   v1  v2  v3 )              (  d                  )
    (      d   e   v2  v3 )              (  e   d              )
    (          d   e   v3 )              (  v0  e   d          )
    (              d   e  )              (  v0  v1  e   d      )
    (                  d  )              (  v0  v1  v2  e   d  )

  where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of T, and vi
  denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).
