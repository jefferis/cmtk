One-sample t-test

This test checks three hypotheses about the mean of the given sample.  The
following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is equal  to  the  given
      value)
    * left-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  mean  is  greater  than  or
      equal to the given value)
    * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the mean is less than or  equal
      to the given value).

The test is based on the assumption that  a  given  sample  has  a  normal
distribution and  an  unknown  dispersion.  If  the  distribution  sharply
differs from normal, the test will work incorrectly.

Input parameters:
    X       -   sample. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
    N       -   size of sample.
    Mean    -   assumed value of the mean.

Output parameters:
    T           -   Value of T statistic
    BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                    If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                    If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.
    RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                    If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                    the null hypothesis is rejected.

This test checks three hypotheses about the mean of the given samples. The
following tests are performed:
    * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the means are equal)

      less than or equal to the mean of the second sample).

Test is based on the following assumptions:
    * given samples have normal distributions
    * dispersions are equal
    * samples are independent.
