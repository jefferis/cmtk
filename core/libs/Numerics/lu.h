LU decomposition of a general matrix of size MxN

The subroutine calculates the LU decomposition of a rectangular general
matrix with partial pivoting (with row permutations).

Input parameters:
    A   -   matrix A whose indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..N-1].
    M   -   number of rows in matrix A.
    N   -   number of columns in matrix A.

Output parameters:
    A   -   matrices L and U in compact form (see below).
            Array whose indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..N-1].
    Pivots - permutation matrix in compact form (see below).
            Array whose index ranges within [0..Min(M-1,N-1)].

Matrix A is represented as A = P * L * U, where P is a permutation matrix,
matrix L - lower triangular (or lower trapezoid, if M>N) matrix,
U - upper triangular (or upper trapezoid, if M<N) matrix.

Let M be equal to 4 and N be equal to 3:

                   (  1          )    ( U11 U12 U13  )
A = P1 * P2 * P3 * ( L21  1      )  * (     U22 U23  )
                   ( L31 L32  1  )    (         U33  )
                   ( L41 L42 L43 )

Matrix L has size MxMin(M,N), matrix U has size Min(M,N)xN, matrix P(i) is
a permutation of the identity matrix of size MxM with numbers I and Pivots[I].

The algorithm returns array Pivots and the following matrix which replaces
matrix A and contains matrices L and U in compact form (the example applies
to M=4, N=3).

 ( U11 U12 U13 )
 ( L21 U22 U23 )
 ( L31 L32 U33 )
 ( L41 L42 L43 )

As we can see, the unit diagonal isn't stored.
