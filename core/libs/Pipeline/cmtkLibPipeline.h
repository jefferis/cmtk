/** \defgroup Pipeline
 *\title Pipeline processing library
 * This library provides pipeline-based processing similar to the paradigms
 * used by VTK and, to lesser extent, ITK.
 *\deprecated This library is deprecated and should not be relied on for
 * future development. It is currently only maintained to the extent
 * necessary to keep the "triplanar" viewer program functional.
