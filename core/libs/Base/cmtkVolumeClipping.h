/** Utility class for volume clipping.
 * This class provides functions to compute intersections of volumes with
 * lines, planes, and other volumes. Line-to-volume intersection can be
 * computed by a single function call.
 *
 * Plane to volume intersection is done by first computing a range of parallel
 * lines that intersect the volume. Then, for each line the line to volume
 * intersection has to be computed to determine the exact intersection.
 *
 * Analog, for volume to volume intersection, first a range of parallel planes
 * is determined. Those then have to be examined in separate as described
 * before.
 *
 * This class' main application is ray clipping for DRR computation and volume
 * clipping for voxel based volume similarity computation. All member functions
 * are static, so they can be used without contructing an object.

  /** Compute line-to-volume intersection.
   * This function computes the part of a lines that lies within a given
   * volume.
   *\return This function returns 1 if and only if there is a non-empty
   * intersection of line and volume. In this case, the intersection is
   * described by fromFactor and toFactor.
   *\param fromFactor If the function returned 1, this variable holds the
   * relative distance to the entrance point of the line into the volume.
   * 0 means the line's starting point, 1 means its end.
   *\param toFactor If the function returned 1, this variable holds the
   * relative distance to the exit point of the line from the volume. Possible
   * values range from 0 to 1 and have the same meaning as fromFactor.
   *\param offset This 3D vector is the line's starting point.
   *\param initFromFactor The fromFactor parameter's value is initialized
   * with this value. It is therefore the lower bound of the parameter range
   * that is available for intersection.
   *\param initToFactor The toFactor parameter's value is initialized
   * with this value. It is therefore the upper bound of the parameter range
   * that is available for intersection. One application for this parameter
   * is to use a value bigger than 1, even if [0,1] is the allowed range. Then,
   * by testing if toFactor == 1.0, it can be determined whether clipping
   * set the value to 1. This, for example allows to tell closed from open
   * intervals, which may be important for subsequent computation such as
   * volume probing.
   *\param lowerClosed This flag defines whether lower range boundaries are
   * open (value 0, default) or closed (value 1). In case of an open range,
   * the bounding value itself is not an element of the range. Thus, if an
   * intersection is entirely on the boundary, then it is empty in case of an
   * open range.
   *\param upperClosed This flag has the same meaning and default as
   * lowerClosed, but refers to the ranges' upper bounds.
