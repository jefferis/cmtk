- Added: "sympl" tool can now use different approximated symmetry plane
    orientations to begin search, supporting non-sagittal symmetry planes
    [Tracker #3834].

    off.
- Fixed: crash of average_affine tool when run with no parameters 
    [Tracker #3841]

- API: all "VM_" class prefixes replaced with more explicit "VoxelMatching"

- Added: Windows implementation of dcm2image file scanning

- Changed: CMake switches for changing coordinate and data real type are now
    advanced.

    Visual Studio.

- Improved: pre-defined "--xml" and "--help" command line options can now be
    overridden by library user [Tracker #3830].

- Removed: cmtk::MathUtil::CoefficientOfCorrelation was removed because it
    turned out to be a redundant, numerically unstable variant of
    MathUtil::Correlation
- Removed: deprecated options -m/--metric removed from registration and warp
    tools.
- Removed: obsolete tool skeleton "detect_interleave"
- Removed: obsolete "--threads" option from all remaining command lines; using
    CMTK_NUM_THREADS environment variable is more flexible and versatile.

- Bugfix: Nrrd reader now only changes coordinate space to "RAS" if input
    image was defined in anatomy-based coordinate system (RAS, LAS, LPS).
- Bugfix: create igsDataGrid objects without setting anatomical orientation,
    because we may be dealing with non-human data. Instead, set meta data of
    created volumes from input data where possible.
- Bugfix: do not try to assemble volumes from single-slice studies to avoid
    segfaults in dcm2image

    igsVolume object.

- Added: label stack entropy operator for imagemath tool with test
- Added: test for imagemath vote operator

    pointer was passed to it.
- Bugfix: preserve space axes and direction vectors in 
    igsUniformVolume::GetCroppedVolume()

    ReadOriented() when reading images linked from groupwise archives.

- Changed: ported GUI classes and applications to Qt4; require at least Qt4.3,
    as we are using features introduced with that version (Issue #13).

    we know that if the header file exists, the data was successfully written.

    by renaming these to Inver2x2 and Invert3x3, respectively (Issue #30)

    argument, which is equivalent to bringing the warp into its pure nonrigid
    representation.

    constructor; now we no longer look at the volume's own transformation.
- Internal: igsReformatVolume::AffineXform now the actual FORWARD

    boundaries due to missing upper for loop bounds
