Release CMTK-1.7.2:

(r3277) Changed/fixed: padding flag and value are now propagated to the new
    array when converting the scalar data type of an existing array.


Release CMTK-1.7.1 (2011-07-14):

(r3270) Added: new "probe" tool implements "volume probe" functionality
    formerly provided by "describe" tool, with several extensions such as
    flexible coordinate specification and interpolation modes.
(r3265) Fixed: potential infinite loop in "imagemath" tool when images of
    different size were on the stack for a multi-image operation.
(r3263) Fixed: crash in SMP nonrigid registration due to incorrect use of
    number of tasks submitted to thread pool.
(r3256) Added: missing "histogram pruning" operator in "convertx" tool.
(r3198) Added: symmetric optimization of forward and inverse affine
    transformation in "registrationx" tool.
(r3190) Fixed: when reformatting a moving image, the reformatted image now
    inherits the input image's padding flag and value. This addresses an issue
    with reformatted floating-point images breaking Slicer and other tools do
    to "Inf" used for padding by default. The registration tools can now be
    run with the "--pad-flt" flag to set input image padding, which then
    propagates into the reformatted output image.
(r3187) Added: new "destripe" tool removes stripe artifacts from accross-slice
    intensity variations.
(r3176) Added: "convertx" tool now supports downsampling by pixel selection in
    addition to downsampling by pixel averaging.


Release CMTK-1.7.0 (2011-04-18):

(r3158) Fixed: allow OpenMP to be disabled by initial CMake cache file, which
    is necessary on MacOS to allow automated release building.
(r3151) Added: two-level command line help; "--help" now prints only basic
    options, whereas "--help-all" prints all options including those marked as
    "advanced." this should make it easier for new users to get a quick
    overview of essential functions.
(r3120) Fixed: Nrrd library was not properly splitting file paths containing
    Windows-style separators ('\' rather than '/').
(r3118) Improved: bundled NrrdIO library was updated to 1.11.0 from 1.9.0.
(r3114) Fixed: CMTK now compiles with OpenMP support using VisualStudio
    compilers. All OpenMP parallel loops are now using signed, rather than
    unsigned, loop variables, thus complying with older (pre-3) versions of
    the OpenMP standard.
(r3079) Fixed: reading of uncompressed BioRad (and potentially other format)
    files was broken (patch by Greg Jefferis).
(r3062) Fixed: problem with directory creation due to difference path
    separator characters for Windows vs. POSIX.
(r3059) Fixed: broken thread semaphores on Windows due to incorrect
    conditional compilation. (This bug was introduced in r1661.)
(r3031) Fixed: problem with instantiation of static smart pointer "NULL"
    object led to crashes on MacOS-X platform. This has been fixed.
(r3031) Fixed: linking errors when building shared libraries on MacOS, caused
    by missing library dependencies.
(r3003) Improved: CMTK now employs a toolkit-wide, centralized, fine-grain
    framework for diagnostic outputs of user-defined detail level. Every
    command line tool supports the new "--verbose-level" option; output
    previously generated using the deprecated "--verbose" option is at level
    "1" and can thus be enabled by "--verbose-level 1".
(r2974) Added: initial support for Grand Central Dispatch, including GCD-based
    backend for thread pool parallel model.
(r2919) Added: regional image filters, such as mean, variance, and third
    moment added to "convertx" tool.
(r2908) Changed: "--verbose" output now written to standard output, not
    standard error (Issue #5496).
(r2905) Added: "reformatx" and "convertx" tools now support "unsigned int"
    pixel data type for output files (Issue #5497).


Release CMTK-1.6.1 (2011-02-17):

(r2886) Fixed: crash in "fview" fusion viewer application due to incorrect
    interface of class derived from QApplication.
    (see http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2008-01/thread00570-0.html)
(r2884) Added: all CMTK command line tools now support the "--version"
    argument to print the CMTK version number.
(r2878) Fixed: "--write-reformatted" option of "registration" tool was
    broken. In some cases, the wrong image was used as the fixed image.
(r2871) Fixed: pipe-based decompression was broken on MacOSX
(r2869) Improved: "runcheck" tool is now more sensitive to stdlibc++ version.


Release CMTK-1.6.0 (2011-02-01):

(r2858) Added: "mk_phantom_3d" can now read MRS voxel location and size from
    GE DICOM files and draw voxel in correct location, if image grid with matching
    physical scanner coordinates is imported.
(r2845) Improved: "volume_injection" and "volume_reconstruction" tools now
    produce reconstructed images with physical space coordinates matching
    those of the first input image.
(r2829) Improved: various fixes related to packaging. Now uses non-default
    installation prefix, renamed installation components, added missing RPM
    fields.
(r2818) Fixed: building using MacOSX SDK 10.4u now uses gcc version 4.0, which
    works, unlike the default gcc-4.2 with this SDK version.
(r2815) Added: CMTK build can now be configured to use bundled sqlite3
    library, even when system library is available. This avoids problems with
    multiple different versions of the library in different SDKs on MacOS.
(r2815) Updated: bundled sqlite3 library has been updated to version 3.7.4.
(r2805) Added: "convertx" can now apply mapping functions to replace image
    values with other values or with padding data.
(r2794) Improved: better default configurations for MacOS-X builds.
(r2794) Fixed: packaging and installation directories.
(r2772) Fixed: label combination by voting now supports up to 32768 labels
    (was 256).
(r2768) Removed: unused and redundant "probe_xform" and "average_grey"
    applications. Use "gregxform" and "reformatx"/"average_images" instead.
(r2765) Removed: largely unused and incomplete support for building a single
    "cmtk" binary wrapper for all command line tools.
(r2760) Removed: now-obsolete "convert" tool has been retired. Operations
    still missing in "convertx" will be added as the need arises.
(r2756) Added: "convertx" tool gained two more missing operations from
    "convert", namely replace padded pixels and pixels with Inf/NaN values.
(r2752) Improved: addressing all warnings reported by "doxygen", source code
    documentation has been completed.
(r2733) Removed: the "congeal", "groupwise_rmi", "congeal_warp", and
    "groupwise_rmi_warp" tools have been removed. These are replaced by the
    "groupwise_affine" and "groupwise_warp" tools introduced in the previous
    release.


Release CMTK-1.5.4 (2011-01-13):

(r2714) Changed: all command line tools now default to writing output in NIFTI
    format, not Analyze, if no output file name is given.
(r2708) Added: new "groupwise_warp" tool for nonrigid groupwise registration
    unites the "congeal_warp" and "groupwise_rmi-warp" tools, which will be
    removed in the next release of CMTK.
(r2705) Added: new "groupwise_affine" tool for affine groupwise registration
    unites the "congeal" and "groupwise_rmi" tools, which will be removed in
    the next release of CMTK.
(r2695) Fixed: subtle and rare numerical problem leading to NAN values in
    image-to-physical matrix read from Nifti files with quaternion-based
    orientation.
(r2684) Fixed: improved installation and packaging by fixing multiple problems
    related to CMTK use files and scripts.
(r2680) Improved: better naming, grouping, and documentation of "film",
    "volume_injection", and "volume_reconstruction" command line options. Also
    named equivalent options consistently between these tools.
(r2664) Fixed: restricting "warpx" tool deformation to certain coordinate
    directions was broken.


Release CMTK-1.5.3 (2010-12-13):

(r2652) Improved: CMTK can now be more flexibly configured to use bundled zlib
    over existing system zlib. This is partially addressing Issue #5395, with
    a patch provided by Kent Williams. This also fixes Issue #5382, because
    we no longer depend on Darwin's broken system zlib.
(r2629) Fixed: LZMA decompression was broken on i686 due to bug in
    lzmadec_seek(). The decompression backend classes now use a common fake
    "seek" implementation if seek is not supported by the low-level backend or
    broken. 
(r2613) Fixed: "dbtool" was warning of unused command line parameters.
(r2611) Fixed: properly exit "fview" application with an exception when one of
    the input images cannot be read.


Release CMTK-1.5.2 (2010-12-06):

(r2591) Fixed: previous release accidentally removed the ability of CMTK's
    image writer to recursively create non-existing directories in the output
    path.


Release CMTK-1.5.1 (2010-12-02):

(r2580) Fixed: segmentation fault when getting cropped subvolume after
    providing out-of-range cropping boundaries.
(r2575) Fixed: all output images are now written in the same orientation and
    pixel array order as the respective input images. Previously, images were
    written in internal order, i.e., RAS or closest orientation supported by
    output file format. For backward compatibility, the old behaviour can be
    turned back on by defining the "CMTK_LEGACY_WRITE_IMAGES_RAS" environment
    variable. 
(r2563) Fixed: "dcm2image" tool choked on non-DICOM files.
(r2560) Added: "dcm2image" tool has new option to ignore AcquisitionNumber tag
    when grouping images, which is useful for Siemens fMRI series. Tool also
    now warns if images are left over that cannot be assigned to any stack.
(r2558) Fixed: CMake initial cache files for pre-defined configurations now
    set cache variables.


Release CMTK-1.5.0 (2010-11-17):

(r2544) Added: "similarity" in label mode now prints Jaccard index, J.
(r2540) Fixed: all command line tools now use a C++-safe exit mechanism based
    on throwing an exit exception that is caught in a safe main() wrapper
    function. 
(r2540) Fixed: CommandLine class was leaking memory because some local classes
    did not have virtual destructors (Issue #5320).
(r2512) Fixed: SmartPointer::DynamicCastFrom() was leaking memory due to
    implicit, rather than explicit, call to inherited constructor.
(r2505) Added: "film" tool now has "--padding-value" option to define a
    padding value for the input image. Also to get this to work,
    UniformVolume::GetInterleavedSubvolume() now copies padding flag and value
    from input data to output.
(r2502) Fixed: "ReformatVolume::CreateInterpolator" did not actually create a
    nearest neighbor interpolator when so requested.
(r2500) Fixed: "imagemath" tool performed incorrect operations for the "exp"
    and  "sqrt" do to incorrect function wrapper.
(r2495) Added: "dcm2image" tool can now optionally sort output images by
    instance numbers of the input image files, rather than by their
    names. This is useful when using variable-length numbered files that must
    be stacked in order (e.g., for functional MRI).
(r2483) Added: "fview" fusion viewer tool can now switch between no
    transformation (identity), affine-only and full nonrigid transformation.
(r2479) Fixed: ITK transformations must be in LPS space, regardless of the
    coordinate spaces of the images being registered.
(r2467) Fixed: make consistent use of C memory allocator to avoid conflicts
    between core CMTK and external libraries (e.g., NrrdIO).
(r2467) Added: "warp" and "warpx" tools have new option, "--relax-to-unfold"
    to unfold deformation regions with negative Jacobians before continuing
    at the next resolution level. Hopefully, this will allow more aggressive
    deformations without incurring folding, thus improving registration
    accuracy.
(r2450) Removed: support for pixelwise incompressibility weight maps, which
    was never really used and hasn't been exposed at the command line for a
    while. 
(r2445) Fixed: conversion of affine transformation to/from ITK format and
    native image space failed when fixed and moving images resided in different
    spaces (fixed image space was used for both of them).
(r2440) Fixed: newly created transformation objects should, by default, set
    their coordinate space to CMTK's default space, RAS.
(r2436) Added: "mk_nifti_hdr" tool to create NIFTI headers from scratch or
    patch existing headers.
(r2434) Fixed: "CMakeFiles" directory gets in the way of in-source builds
    (Issue #5269). Thanks to Dominique Belhachemi for report and fix.
(r2422) Fixed: "registrationx" tool ignored user specification for transform
    initializer and always used an identity transformation unless an explicit
    initial alignment was provided.
(r2416) Changed: "make_initial_affine" now defaults to writing transformations
    in CMTK standard RAS space, rather than between native image spaces. This
    makes much more sense, because in all likelihood it will be other CMTK
    tools reading these transformations.
(r2408) Fixed: average images created by the groupwise registration tools did
    not have proper coordinate space information. Also made the default output
    image type NIFTI (instead of Analyze) to produce files with fully
    specified coordinate systems.
(r2395) Fixed/Added: triplanar viewer now displays RAS physical coordinates of
    current location; also fixed problem with repeated slice position change
    after a single mouse click.
(r2390) Changed: by default, the DICOM image stacker, "dcm2image," now writes
    NIFTI files with attached header (.nii) rather than Analyze hdr/img
    pairs. This is because Analyze format does not properly represent the
    image location and orientation information obtained from the DICOM input
    images.
(r2380) Removed: several hundred lines of unused, obsolete code was removed
    from the Numerics library.


Release CMTK-1.4.3 (2010-09-28):

(r2365) Fixed: "xform2dfield" and "xform2scalar" tools did not respect
    CMTK_NUM_THREADS variable, as they were only using OpenMP directly.
(r2359) Added: by default, CMTK is now built with support for on-the-fly
    decompression of bzip2 and lzma-compressed files if libbzip2 and/or
    liblzmadec and their respective header files are installed on the build
    system. Also rewrote the decompression class, cmtk::CompressedStream, from
    scratch to be more easily extended.
(r2345) Fixed: prevent "dcm2image" tool from trying to read compressed (using
    gzip, etc.) DICOM files, as these cannot be read by DCMTK right now.
(r2337) Added: "describe" tool now prints machine-readable image-to-physical
    space transformation matrix. Also transposed matrix output to make it
    compatible with "mat2dof" tool.
(r2329) Improved: poor description of command line arguments in "split" tool.
(r2327) Fixed: broken Makefiles when source path contained space.
(r2317) Refactored: eliminated several hundred lines of unused and obsolete
    code, including several classes.
(r2309) Fixed: because gcc/OpenMP breaks POSIX semaphores on Cygwin, use
    CMTK's mutex/condition implementation instead (Issue #4779)
(r2294) Improved: eliminating calls to floor() improved registration times by
    another ~10%.
(r2287) Improved: apparently using histogram entropy is computed faster
    without OpenMP parallelization, reducing test times for the "warp" tool by
    about 30%. This should be noticable in production use also. No surprise,
    actually, because most entropy evaluations are done in parallel on a
    higher level anyway.
(r2281) Fixed: "reformatx" tool did not properly initiatialize thread system,
    therefore running too many OpenMP threads even when CMTK_NUM_THREADS was
    set.


Release CMTK-1.4.2 (2010-08-23):

(r2268) Fixed: various compile errors when compiling Qt support classes using
    Sun/Oracle compiler.
(r2261) Refactored: new "XformListIO" class provides a static member function
    that assembles lists of transformations with optional inversions from
    string vectors as supplied by the command line parse. This new class is
    used to unify three instances where this was previously done by code
    duplication.
(r2254) Added: new, lightweight "fview" fusion viewer replaces old, broken,
    and incomplete "fusion" application.
(r2213) Bugfix: UniformVolume::GridMatches sometimes returned "false" due to
    differences below the numerical relevance threshold.
(r2202) Added: "--force-outside-value" command line argument now also offered
    and implemented for affine registration.
(r2197) Improved: UniformVolumeInterpoaltor classes now convert input data to
    Types::DataItem and cache the converted array for faster computation. This
    particularly speeds up higher-order interpolation with cubic or sinc
    kernels.


Release CMTK-1.4.1 (2010-08-09):

(r2178) Improved: when run as Slicer plugins, GPU-accelerated command line
    tools now categorize themselves into "->GPU" submenus.
(r2176) Refactored: command line arguments now passed to CommandLine::Parse,
    rather than constructor.
(r2171) Fixed: "new" registration classes (exposed in "registrationx" and
    "warpx" tools) now respect reference image padding. Also fixed bug that
    led to loss of padding information during resampling.
(r2166) Added: "registrationx" tool now supports special number of degrees of
    freedom, "603", which produces a rigid transformation plus shears, but without
    scaling (i.e., it uses 6+0+3 parameters of the affine transformation)
(r2160) Added: on-the-fly median filtering for "registrationx" and "warpx"
    tools.
(r2156) Added: root mean squares image similarity measure for "registrationx"
    and "warpx" tools. This is of course very similar to mean squares (MSD),
    but exhibits different sensitivity to outliers.
(r2138) Added: GPU-accelerated levelset tool for CUDA, "levelset_cuda."
(r2111) Refactored: simple two-phase levelset evolution moved from "levelset"
    tool into a new Segmentation/ library class, cmtk::SimpleLevelset.
(r2107) Refactored: UniformVolume::Clone and CloneGrid now return smart
    rather than dumb pointers.
(r2103) Added: GPU/cmtkCUDA.h defines macros to safely call CUDA API functions
    and check their error codes.
(r2097) Added: a new class, cmtk::ImageSymmetryPlaneCommandLine, together with
    a derived class template unifies the tools for CPU-based and GPU-based
    symmetry plane computation.
(r2094) Added: GPU-supported symmetry plane computation tool, "symplx_cuda",
    which is used analogously to CPU-based "symplx" tool.
(r2060) Added: cmtk::ParametricPlane class can now provide the 4x4 matrix of
    the reflection transformation w.r.t. the plane.
(r2035) Refactored: all cmtk header files are now included via paths relative
    to the library parent directory.
(r2019) Refactored: split new symmetry plane functional into base class and
    metric-dependent class. Base class will be shared by GPU implementation.
(r2016) Added: new "symplx" tool that will extend, and ultimately replace, the
    current "sympl" tool for symmetry plane computation.
(r2012) Fixed: concurrent memory access problems in GPU kernel to populate
    histograms on device.
(r2006) Improved: imagemath tool now prints a warning when more than one image
    is left on the operation stack. This often indicates a problem with the
    specified image operations.
(r2003) Fixed: require compatible version of SQLite (>= 3.5.0), otherwise
    build bundled library.
(r1999) Added: "--product" operation for imagemath tool.
(r1996) Fixed: mrbias_cuda tool and curt validation tool now properly
    self-identify on the command line and via XML.


Release CMTK-1.4.0 (2010-07-12):

- Fixed: header files are now installed in library-specific subdirectories,
    which is consistent with the source tree.
- Improved: bundled SQLite is now only built if no system-wide library is
    found.
- Added: "imagemath" tool now supports applying single-image operations to the
    entire stack.
- Improved: "imagemath" tool now uses deque, not stack, to implement image
    stack. This way we can perform all-image operations more easily.
- Improved: log-Intensity histograms are now value scale invariant.
- Removed: building against VTK is no longer supported.
- Added: class for histogram population and entropy computation on GPU
    device.
- Added: vtkxform tool can now read (and write) binary-coded VTK files.
- Added: first utility classes (memory allocation and resource management,
    volume data transfer) for GPU computation using CUDA.
- Testing: added test name to function mapper cmtk::TestFunctionMap to
    simplify writing of test drivers.
- API: some Numerics functions from AlgLib were moved into ::alglib namespace
    to avoid clashes with functions also defined elsewhere (e.g., gamma, erf,
    etc).
- Refactored: thread function within thread pool is now provided with thread
    index directly, rather having to perform a lookup (Issue #4939).
- Added: cmtk::CommandLine class prints warning message if not all command
    line arguments are actually used. This usually points to a usage error.
- Added: 'vtkxform' tool now accepts list of transformations, each of which
    can be inverted.
- API: change interface of SplineWarpXform::getTransformedGridSequence() to
    isolate "number of points" parameter and make it harder to use this
    incorrectly.
- Refactored: use more smart pointers in more places. Standardize Clone() and
    Create() member functions of different classes.
- Improved: parallelized computation of FFD smoothness constraint. This
    greatly improves multicore scaling of nonrigid registration using this
    constraint. 
- Removed: "describe" tool no longer prints center of mass and first-order
    moments. If we ever need this, we'll make a separate tool for this.
- Refactored: further consolidated Vector3D into FixedVector
- Documentation: marked VTKWrapper library as deprecated.


Release CMTK-1.3.1 (2010-06-07):

- Added: "vtkxform" tool to apply transformation to point coordinates in VTK
    files (does not require VTK support to be enabled or VTK to be
    installed).
- Fixed: tiny numerical differences between division and multiplication with
    the inverse caused failed range check assertion in SplineWarpXform (Issue
    #4894). This is now fixed by replacing the assertion with a value range
    truncation. It ain't pretty, but it works.
- Configuration: added two CMake initial script files in config/ directory,
    which should support and standardize backward-compatible builds on
    MacOSX/Intel (Issue #4895; thanks to Greg Jefferis for suggesting these).
- Added: several features previously implemented only in congeal_warp have
    been ported into groupwise_rmi_warp. Also added tests for the latter.
- Refactored: completely reorganised the groupwise registration functional
    hierarchy - instead of redundant member functions in leaf classes, we are
    now using template specialization to inject the necessary transformation
    model-dependent code at the base of the hierarchy. 
- Fixed: previously undetected bug in AffineGroupwiseRegistrationRMI
    functional effectively led to inverse transformations to be computed.
- API: renamed CongealingFunctionalBase to more appropriate
    GroupwiseRegistrationFunctionalXformTemplate and removed unused second
    template parameter (histogram bin type) from several classes.
- Improved: CMTK can now determine whether to write compressed (gz) or
    uncompressed NIFTI images based on the given file name, e.g., image.nii.gz
    for compressed vs. image.nii for uncompressed. Note that for this to work
    as expected the "CMTK_WRITE_UNCOMPRESSED" environment vairbale must be
    set, because otherwise images will be written compressed by
    default. Also note that CMTK's behaviour with respect to writing
    compressed  vs. uncompressed files has not changed for all other file
    formats (Issue #4852).
- Fixed: when using an unknown image file format suffix, CMTK would state that
    it would write a RAW3D file instead, but then write nothing. This now
    defaults to single-file NIFTI, which is actually written (Issue #4852).
- Refactored: consolidated affine initialization of groupwise registration
    functionals to reduce code duplication and thus avoid residual unfixed
    bugs.
- Improved: when initializing groupwise registrations, translations are now
    computed with a zero sum over all images. Previously, we aligned all
    centers with the template FOV center, but there is no reason why this
    would be a good idea when using, for example, centers of mass of the input
    images.
- Added: groupwise registration tools now abort with an error when at least
    one of the input images get transformed too far outside the FOV. This is
    detected in cmtk::CongealingFunctionalBase and defaults to requiring at
    least 1% of reformatted pixels to be inside the FOV of every image. At
    present, this is not configurable at run time.
- Removed: support for writing joint histograms.
- Refactored: value ranges are now handled by Types::Range<T> class
    template. The specialization typedef'ed as Types::DataItemRange is now
    used for more intuitive handling of item ranges.
- Fixed: selection of floating image interpolation method was implemented in
    warpx tool, but not exposed at the command line.
- Fixed: auto-cropping by threshold was implemented in image pair registration
    preprocessor class, but not exposed through the command line interface.
- Added: padding in convertx tool can now be turned on and off multiple times
    during the sequence of operations, including the use of different padding
    values at different times.
- Added: connected components operator; also added this as a function to
    convertx tool.
- Configuration/build: when system zlib is installed, we use it instead of the
    bundled zlib. This is necessary to avoid version issues when Qt support is
    activated, because Qt is linked against the system zlib.
- Distribution: updated version of bundled zlib to 1.2.5, which fixes valgrind
    warnings among other things. In the process, fixed a configuration file
    bug by which the system zconf.h file, if present, was included rather than
    the one configured for CMTK.
- Fixed: in some cases, TypedArray memory was allocated via malloc() but freed
    via delete[]. Now everything is consistently using cmtk::Memory (wraps
    new{} and delete[]) for allocation and deallocation.
- Fixed: Correlation Ratio similarity measure was broken due to imcomplete
    copying of class fields in HistogramBase class. This was resolved
    "accidentally" when unifying and standardizing all copy constructors and
    assignment operators.
- Refactored: non-standard copy member functions in various classes have been
    standardized as operator=() members. Assignment operators and copy
    constructors that performed only member-wise copies were deleted
    altogether.
- API: renamed "InfinitePlane" class to "ParametricPlane" which is more
    descriptive and precise.
- Added: CMake configuration of CUDA and OpenCL support for future GPU
    computations. Currently unused and experimental.
- Refactored: UniformDistanceMap is now a factory class and no longer directly
    inherits from UniformVolume.
- API: renamed "GetDownsampled" member in DataGrid and UniformVolume classes
    to "GetDownsampledAndAveraged" to clarify that this is a
    downsampling-and-averaging operation, not just a downsampling.
- Refactored: greatly improved handling of grid index and region types.
- Added: SmartConstPointer, based on concepts in Meyer's "More Effective C++"
    book.
- Removed: unused classes from the deprecated "Pipeline" library
- Documentation: describe library groups in doxygen documentation
- Libraries: all reconstruction-related classes were consolidated in a new
    component library, "cmtkRecon"
- Removed: unused cmtk::DirectionSetOptimizer class.
- Removed: unused member functions of cmtk::Vector that complicate the API and
    stand in the way of eventually replacing this class with std::valarray.
- Refactored: where appropriate, catch exceptions by constant references,
    rather than by value or by non-constant reference.


Release CMTK-1.3.0 (2010-04-19):

- Added: a new command line tool, "dbtool", to modify, query, and maintain
    databases of images and of transformations between them.
- Fixed: consolidated redundant "--switch" and "--exchange" parameters to
    "warp" tool (Issue #3616). Also fixed initial transformation missing
    inversion bug (unreported) for inverse-consistent nonrigid registration.
- Fixed: if this is supported, default to terminal width for line width in
    cmtk::Console::FormatText
- Added: image/transformation database support for the following registration
    tools: "registration", "registrationx", "warp", "reformatx"
- API: cmtk::MetaInformationObject is getting a more explicit and
    task-appropriate interface.
- API: refactored multi-channel registration class hierarchy to factor common
    code out of template class and into new non-template base class
    cmtk::MultiChannelRegistrationFunctionalBase 
- Added: mat2dof tool can now read from file in addition to reading from
    std::cin via redirection.
- API: introduced "cmtk::Units" namespace with classes that handle conversions
    between units, e.g., between degrees and radians. Also added unit-safe
    trigonometric functions to MathUtil class.
- Refactored: numerous code improvements based on suggestions from the third
    edition of Meyers, S., "Effective C++"
- Removed: obsolete real-valued mod operators in MathUtil namespace.
- Removed: long unused support for GIPL image file format import
- Fix: volume_reconstruction and volume_injection tools now convert affine ITK
    transformations (i.e., such read from .tfm files) from native into
    standard space (Issue #4761).
- API: made all meta key strings C++ objects rather than cpp #defines; also
    removed CMTK_ prefix after moving them into cmtk namespace.
- API: renamed "InformationObject" class to more descriptive
    "MetaInformationObject"
- Fixed: various issues pointed out by "cppcheck" static code analysis.
- API: moved morphological operators from cmtk::DataGrid into separate class,
    cmtk::DataGridMorphologicalOperators.
- API: prevent copying of system classes where this would lead to problems.
- Added: filter, levelset, make_initial_affine, mrbias, and reformatx tools
    now support database updating.
- Added: database backend for storing images and transformations between their
    coordinate spaces.
- Added: "convertx --binarize-thresh" operation
- Bugfix: shared-library build configuration was broken.
- Bugfix: "convertx --mask-inverse" was broken.
- Added: "mk_phantom_3d" tool can now import either an image including
    existing pixel data or just the grid geometry.
- Added: "mk_phantom_3d" tool now supports three different coordinate modes:
    absolute, relative, indexed.
- Added: "--revert" image operation for "imagemath" tool to revert binary
    masks.
- API: moved "DrawXXX" members from "DataGrid" class into a new, dedicated
    painter class, "UniformVolumePainter."
- Added: image operation for medial skeleton based on analysis of the Hessian
    eigensystem. Note that this is currently broken and only kept for future
    investigation.
- Added: two differential operator members for "UniformVolume" class, one for
    gradient and one for Hessian matrix, each implemented using central
    differences.
- Added: symmetric eigensystem can now be sorted either by absolute or by
    actual eigenvalues.
- Bugfix: UniformDistanceMap constructor failed to copy orientation and
    space-related information from input UniformVolume object
- Added: Euclidean distance map computation in "convertx" tool.
- Added: "warpx" and "congeal_warp" can now do repeated histogram-based
    intensity matching of floating to reference image, with a transfer
    function that changes as warping progresses and thus takes into account
    shifting volume proportions.
- Added: "convertx" now does histogram equalization. Also added tests.
- Refactored: created a new class for histogram-based intensity matching,
    cmtk::HistogramMatchingLookup.
- Added: first library-level tests for TypedArray class.


Release CMTK-1.2.2 (2010-02-25):

- Added: cmtk::SQLite wrapper class for sqlite3 library, with tests.
- Added: bundled still-unused sqlite3 "library" for future use in
    image/relationship database.
- Added: "imagemath" now has "min-value" and "fill" operations.
- Improved: "imagemath" can now set, unset, and change padding value
    repeatedly, so different images can be read with different padding values
    (Issue #4597)
- Improved: better separation of code for DICOM vs non-DICOM configuration.
- Improved: code for PGM output (8 and 16 bit) now more consistent and less
    complex. Also unified API for 8bit  and 16bit write functions.
- Added: bitwise "and" operation in "imagemath" tool. Added test for this.
- Testing: added tests for cmtk::TypedArraySimilarity class.
- Fixed: TypedArraySimilarity::GetPeakSignalToNoiseRatio was broken due to
    negated GetMeanSquaredDifference return value.
- Testing: added tests for cmtk::ScalarImageSimilarity class (and, by
    extension, cmtk::TypedArraySimilarity as well).
- Removed: obsolete "ImageIO" class was removed; the only two remaining former
    derived classes, cmtk::PGM and cmtk::DICOM, will now be used directly, as
    they only have static member functions left.
- Fixed: initialize memory for Analyze header with zeroes in "mk_analyze_hdr"
    tool.
- Testing: added tests for "mk_analyze_hdr" tool.
- Testing: added tests for "mat2dof" tool.
- Fixed: "mip" tool did not compute projection images with proper pixel sizes
    based on the input volume.
- Testing: added tests for "mip" tool.
- Improved: "mip" tool now sets black and white points automatically if not
    provided by the user.
- Testing: added test for "Rohlfing" single-image intensity-consistent
    filtering in "filter" tool.
- Removed: further removal of obsolete PGM and DICOM I/O code.


Release CMTK-1.2.1 (2010-02-01):

- Added: "statistics" tool now optionally outputs mask-based results for all
    up to a user-provided maximum label, even if not all labels in the range
    actually occur in the mask.
- Added: "convertx" tool now does thresholding above and below threshold, to
    threshold and to padding.
- Added: re-added missing "--fast" switch for warp and warpx tools.
- Added: "imagemath" can now threshold above and below given values.
- Added: "convertx" tool can now rescale image intensities to target range
    using "--scale-to-range" operation.

- Fixed: reading empty (i.e., zero pixels) images crashed the toolkit
- Fixed: "reformatx" did not respect user-defined padding value when computing
    Jacobian maps (Issue #4564).
- Fixed: label mode of "avg_adm" tool was broken.
- Fixed: "avg_adm" now gives consistent results regardless of number of
    CPUs. Also fixed minor bug that would have broken this altogether if there
    were more CPUs than pixels in an image row.
- Fixed: "avg_adm" tests crashed on MPI; bug also affected non-MPI build
    (Issue #4571).
- Fixed: "statistics" now tests whether grid of mask volume matches that of
    statistics volume.

- Testing: run all warp and warpx tests in "fast" mode
- Testing: added tests, inputs, and baselines for "avg_adm" tool.

- Removed: deformation strain tensor computation was untested and unused; thus
    removed.
- Removed: partial read support for AVW file format removed
- Removed: support for legacy typedstream studies removed; Nrrd should be able
    to replace this if needed.
- Removed: obsolete IO code for DCM tags etc.


Release CMTK-1.2.0 (2010-01-06):

- Added: cmtk::Console can now determine terminal line width on POSIX systems,
    and this is used by cmtk::CommandLine to format command line help output
    with the correct line breaking.
- Added: new, experimental implementation of pairwise image registration,
    with more accurate metric computation and support for arbitrary floating
    image interpolation. These are accessible through the new "registrationx"
    command line tool.
- Added: single-step mass-preserving reformatting in reformatx tool. Also
    added a new test to cover this.
- Added: "convertx" tool, which will replace "convert" in the long term but is
    designed to apply all operations given on the command line in the exact
    order that they are specified and with arbitrary repetitions. This is in
    response to Issue #3784.

- Improved: more sophisticated install and packaging configuration; still not
    fully clear how that translates into separated packages for different
    components.
- Improved: ported everything related to Qt to use the actual Qt4 classes, so
    we can finally get rid of legacy Qt3 support classes. This should reduce
    the number of actually unused dynamic libraries, which we previously had
    to link against.
- Improved: numerous small improvements to triplanar viewer
- Improved: dcm2image tool now numbers images only if there would otherwise be
    filename collisions. The printf()-type numbering has been replaced with
    two new output path substitutions, "%n" and "%N". Both expand to the empty
    string when a path is already unique without numbering. Otherwise, "%n"
    substitutes to an increasing number, and "%N" substitutes to the same
    number with a leading dash, "-". So using "./%n/image%N.nii" generates a
    single file ".//image.nii" if that is a unique path, or a sequence of
    images "./1/image-1.nii", "./2/image-2.nii" for up to ten colliding
    paths. For larger numbers of collisions, the number of digits is
    automatically increased as necessary.
- Improved: command line callback error handling was ugly and tedious; now
    using exceptions to achieve the same effect.

- Changed: in API, all volume "origin" fields were renamed to "offset" to
    avoid confusion with "origin" of coordinate spaces.

- Fixed: bundled DICOM library finally works on all tested platforms and all
    tested compilers.
- Fixed: compile error on latest Mac/Intel gcc due to undefined "ushort"
    type.
- Fixed: triplanar can now be called again with no parameters to open empty
    viewer UI.
- Fixed: set coordinate space meta information for user-defined target grid in
    "reformatx" tool.
- Fixed: using Sun's compiler, there was a problem with the timely
    initialization of SmartPointer<...>::Null when such an object was used in
    the global scope. This led to crashing volume_injection and
    volume_reconstruction tools.

- Removed: support for AMD Core Math Library (ACML), which was rarely used and
    complicated code unnecessarily
- Removed: push-forward function of reformatx has long been obsolete because
    we can invert any transformation and switch reference and floating image,
    to achieve the same effect.
- Removed: "Binary" data class; this should really be treated as "Labels"
    anyway.
- Removed: for now, we are dropping support for system-installed DCMTK
    libraries. The configuration of these was a complete hack anyway. For the
    time being, we will rely exclusively on the bundled, stripped-down version
    of the toolkit for DICOM support.

- Testing: support for baselines local to each build. If a baseline exists in
    testing/baseline/${TESTNAME}, then it will be used. Otherwise, the global
    baseline as configured by the CMTK_DATA_ROOT top-level CMake variable is
    used.
- Testing: added tests for manual target grid definition in "reformatx" tool.


Release CMTK-1.1.3 (2009-11-18):

- Added: new tool, xform2scalar, to extract scalar measures from deformation
    fields or transformations. This, in combination with "statistics" and
    "sequence" tools, obsoletes the old (and inappropriately named)
    "deformation_field" tool.
- Added: scripts for multi-NEX motion correction and iterative shape averaging
    are now configured in build tree and installed in install tree. These (and
    future scripts) will also be included in installable packages.
- Added: B-spline transformation can now be written in ITK file format, thus
    allowing direct import of "warp" transformations into 3D Slicer.
- Added: new binary builds for Solaris on i386 and x86_64 using SunPro CC
    compiler.

- Removed: obsolete "deformation_field" tool.

- Fixed: average_images tool was broken.
- Fixed: numerous unitialized variables and other things that tripped valgrind
    memory checker.
- Fixed: some more missing tests were added to the configuration of the
    bundled D(4)CMTK library.
- Fixed: cmake file to set up tests when no hash map implementation is found
    cannot set properties for mcwarp and mcaffine tests.
- Fixed: numerous compile errors using Sun CC compiler
- Fixed: incomplete Wiki markup of command line help due to incorrectly
    overloaded virtual member function
- Fixed: re-worked CMake build system to eliminate redundant repeated
    libraries
- Fixed: re-arranged "warp" command line parameters to avoid crashing Slicer,
    as it does not allow optional non-option parameters
- Fixed: signal handler functions are now 'extern "C"' to avoid potential
    problems of conflicting linkage
- Fixed: margins for line breaking not correct in Console::FormatText

- Improved: better, more data-drive automatic initialization of optimizer step
    sizes and image sampling parameters in pairwise rigid and nonrigid
    registration.
- Improved: more explicit handling of effective reference and floating volume
    in pairwise registration classes.

- Testing: added tests and baselines for average_images tool.


Release CMTK-1.1.2 (2009-10-28):

- Added: new multi-threading framework based on pools of continuously running
    threads. This should reduce thread creation overhead and also improve
    scheduling by allowing load balancing using over-partitioned tasks, i.e.,
    tasks split into substantially more parts than the number of CPUs.
- Added: logit and logistic functions for imagemath tool, for single and
    multiple images.
- Added: imagemath tool "--match-histograms" operation matches the intensity
    distribution of one image to that of another.
- Added: imagemath tool now supports image data padding.

- Fixed: basic reformatting in groupwise registration used slightly broken
    partitioning for SMP computation. This has been fixed.
- Fixed: NIFTI reader was not able to read files with detached 348-byte
    headers, i.e., headers without "extension" field.
- Fixed: BioRad header problem resulting from struct field alignment (patch by
    Greg Jefferis).
- Fixed: TemplateArray::GetRangeTemplate() now ignores non-finite values, which
    also fixes a crash in triplanar viewer when reading images with non-finite
    values.

- Improved: switched long and short options in command line help and wiki
    markup outputs.


Release CMTK-1.1.1 (2009-09-02):

- Added: "congeal" and "congeal_warp" now optionally match image histograms to
    either template data (if template data is used for registration) or first
    image (if no template is defined or its data is not used).
- Added: groupwise, pairwise, and multi-channel registration tools now each
    support "--delta-f-threshold" option to define termination threshold for
    optimization based on relative target function change.

- Fixed: configuration of type sizes in bundled DICOM library was broken.
- Fixed: file system functions were borken on Windows (MS-VS build) due to use
    of Unix-style directory separators ('/' vs. '\').

- Improved: command line options for "congeal" and "congeal_warp" tools
    streamlined and grouped.
- Improved: help and wiki outputs of command line tool option descriptions now
    include textual descriptions of the argument expected by each option,
    e.g., "float", "string", "image-path".

- Removed: "Mutual Information" variant of RMI-based groupwise registration
    deleted; this turned out to be almost zero and thus useless. For now,
    we're left with optimizing the approximated joint entropy.

- Testing: added tests for all registrations using DeltaF threshold.


Release CMTK-1.1.0 (2009-08-26):

- API: no longer allow short-only options for command lines.
- API: cmtk::SmartPointer now supports smart pointers to constant objects for
    improved const-consistency.
- API: begin decoupling the actual transformation classes (e.g.,
    SplineWarpXform) from their reference image grids (used for
    precomputations). Instead, use classes like the new
    SplineWarpXformUniformVolume to tie both together, thus allowing more
    transformation objects to remain const in more situations (see, for
    example, modified implementation of ReformatVolume::WarpXform).
- API: all "...NonVirtual" member functions replaced their virtual
    counterparts and became virtual themselves.
- API: decoupled VTK and non-VTK landmark code so only one tool,
    align_landmarks, still needs to be linked against the VTKWrapper and VTK 
    libraries.
- API: re-worked progress reporting to support multiple-level nested tasks
- API: removed some residual legacy preprocessor definitions

- Changed: command line tools now need to "opt-in" for XML support. This is to
    prevent cluttering Slicer's menu with modules that do not actually support
    it.
- Changed: finally eliminated all those affine transformation inversions in
    the rigid registration framework that have been a pain for over ten
    years. CAUTION! This changes the outcomes of both affine and warp
    registrations, usually just slightly, but in unstable cases potentially by
    a lot.

- Fixed: mk_analyze_hdr command line option "--description" was broken.
- Fixed: contrary to the Wiki, NMI was the default registration criterion used
    in "film." This has now been changed to MSD, which is most approriate for
    within-modality registration.
- Fixed: ReformatVolume::CheckerboardMode was not initialized
- Fixed: ReformatVolume::CreateInterpoaltor did not support partial volume
    interpolation.
- Fixed: ReformatVolume::MakeTargetImage did not create a grid with proper
    geometry (i.e., offset, direction matrix, meta data).
- Fixed: conversion of non-axial Analyze images to Nrrd produced output file
    that was missing coordinate space definition.
- Fixed: a critical bug that effectively broke all multi-threaded computations
    on Windows (using MS compilers).

- Added: all tools now support "--echo" command line switch, which dumps the
    command line to stdout before continuing with the program.
- Added: the "levelset" and "film" tools now fully support the Slicer3
    execution model. Support in "mrbias" tool has also been improved.
- Added: new "asegment" tool for atlas-based segmentation
- Added: command line class now automatically generates command line syntax
    description for "--help" output, unless a syntax description string is
   explicitly set.
- Added: cmtk::CommandLine class now permits arbitrary-typed variables to be
    set by command line enum parameter groups.
- Added: new optional "asegment_sri24" tool for atlas-based segmentation using
    the SRI24 atlas (currently available only separately from
    http://nitrc.org/projects/sri24/).
- Added: "warp" and "registration" tools now support writing of the
    reformatted floating image without requiring a separate tool, such as
    refortmatx. This makes integration into Slicer much more convenient.
- Added: support Slicer3's XML-based progress reporting, and auto-detect
    Slicer's presence to switch between standard console progress output and
    XML-based output.
- Added: automatic Wiki markup printing of command line options
- Added: export and import of affine transformations in ITK file format for
    exchange with Slicer.
- Added: new class, cmtk::TransformationToNativeSpacesAffine, to change an
    affine transformation under changes of reference and floating image
    coordinate spaces.
- Added: intensity adjustment of floating image in affine and B-spline
    registration using histogram matching

- Removed: multiple redundant command line parameters of the "warp" tool have
    been retired. We are only retaining options that differ from the default
    values.


Release CMTK-1.0.2 (2009-07-24):

- API: all igsGetSetXXX macros are now cmtkGetSetXXX, and they all define the
    field name with a "m_" prefix to avoid type/field name collisions.
- API: more elegant design of noise estimator classes that work on TypedArray
    objects. Mike's experimental ML noise estimator implementations moved to
    "Unstable" library.
- API: new wrapper class "cmtk::HashMapSTL" hides the various STL hash map
    implementations and also adds support for upcoming standard unordered_map
    class.

- Added: source tree now incorporates minimal subset of DCMTK files so we can
    build DICOM support without external dependencies, even on Windows using
    VisualStudio.
- Added: "mcaffine" tool now accepts user-provided initial transformation from
    file [Tracker #3925].
- Added: cmtk::CommandLine class now automatically prints parameter defaults
    in "--help" output.

- Fixed: numerous uninitialized data situations identified by valgrind memory
    checker
- Fixed: incomplete computation when using "--sampling-density" option of
    "congeal" tool.
- Fixed: Slicer can now detect CMTK tools as plugins via their response to
    "--xml"; note that the XML description itself is not fully correct and
    functional yet.
- Fixed: testing and configuration were out of order in top-level
    CMakeLists.txt, resulting in build problems.
- Fixed: "film" tool now uses anisotropic Gaussian kernel for volume
    injection [Tracker #3945].
- Fixed: volume injection should use reconstructed image pixel size to scale
    Gaussian kernel, not pass image pixel size. Pass image size depends on
    number of passes, whereas point spread function does not.

- Improved: eliminated explicit offset calculations in cmtk::DataGrid and use
    existing index-to-offset function instead.
- Improved: instead of trying to figure out what STL version provides, or does
    not provide, a 64bit integer hash function specialization, we simply provide a
    generic hash function ourselves, which works on all platforms.

- Testing: added an experimental build with valgrind/memcheck memory checking
    to discover further issues with uninitialized data etc.
- Testing: support for automated memory testing using valgrind etc.
- Testing: added test for multi-channel affine registration using histograms
- Testing: added actual multi-channel registration test, and test for mcwarp
- Testing: added test for importing deflate-compress DICOM images

- API: changed XformList::Apply to XformList::ApplyInPlace

- Build: added missing applications "regress" and "probe_xform" to default
    build again.

- Changed: probe_xform tool now uses different command line semantics. All
    transformations are concatenated rather than applied separately.

- Added: normal vector of InfinitePlane can now be set directly.
- Added: "sympl" tool can now use different approximated symmetry plane
    orientations to begin search, supporting non-sagittal symmetry planes
    [Tracker #3834].
- Added: established infrastructure for optional algorithm validation,
    beginning with rigid registration. All validation tools must be activated
    via the "BUILD_VALIDATION" option of the top-level CMakeLists.txt file
- Added: tools for rigid registration validation using data from the
    Retrospective Image Registration Evaluation project.
- Added: "registration" tool now supports on-the-fly Sobel edge filtering, and
    histogram equalization was unified with "warp" tool's.

- Fixed: cmtkVoxelMatchingAffineFunctional.h compile error when SMP is turned
    off.
- Fixed: crash of average_affine tool when run with no parameters 
    [Tracker #3841]

- Improved: AffineRegistration and ElasticRegistration now use a new, unified
    image preprocessing class for things like cropping, histogram
    equalization, etc.

- Removed: obsolete cmtk::Array class; replace all uses with std::vector


Release CMTK-1.0.0 (2009-06-16):

- API: "TemplateHistogram", "LogTemplateHistogram", and "TemplateHistogram2D"
    renamed to remove "Template" part. Also removed all global histogram
    typedefs (e.g., "UnsignedIntHistogram") to be more flexible with
    conditional instantiations
- API: "Histogram2D" renamed to "JointHistogram".
- API: all "VM_" class prefixes replaced with more explicit "VoxelMatching"

- Documentation: added extensive documentation with code examples for several
    key classes.

- SVN: moved test data out of "core" tree and into "data"; allow configuration
    of separate (shared) data tree from top-level CMake file

- Added: MiniXML library included in source tree for all upcoming XML needs.
- Added: initial support for XML command line parameter descriptions. Mostly
    infrastructure work to make sure XML can be generated by CommandLine
    class with minimal extra programmer involvement
- Added: cmtk::Console can now typeset text with given margin and width.
- Added: Windows implementation of mutex lock.
- Added: cmtk::StdOut stream
- Added: "--auto-multi-levels" option for registration tool. Selects automatic
    resolution and optimization parameters for given number of levels.
- Added: new top-level configuration option to switch all numerical algorithms
    (i.e., AlgLib) to single-precision floats. This can be used to save memory
    in extreme situations (for example, high-resolution volume reconstruction)
- Added: two new operations for imagemath tool: xor-scalar and contract-labels
- Added: Windows implementation of dcm2image file scanning

- Changed: CMake switches for changing coordinate and data real type are now
    advanced.

- Fixed: numerical instability of correlation coefficient (leading to values
    outside -1..+1, which in turn produced invalid p-values
- Fixed: legacy IGS_MOUNTPOINTS was not considered
- Fixed: principal axes registration was broken [Tracker #3743]
- Fixed: configure problem with bundled zlib, which broke compile of NrrdIO in
    Visual Studio.
- Fixed: Analyze/Nifti images were not written compressed
- Fixed: numerous compiler errors and warnings detected by GCC 4.4

- Improved: simplified code by removing HAVE_ZLIB conditionals. These are now
    always true since we're bundling zlib.
- Improved: use double instead of float for linear model and regression
- Improved: use CMake's FindOpenMP to detect and configure OpenMP
- Improved: prevent configurations where CMTK_USE_THREADS is ON but
    CMTK_BUILD_SMP is OFF.
- Improved: better integration of Doxygen into CMake build system
- Improved: better output of stacked image information in dcm2image
- Improved: pre-defined "--xml" and "--help" command line options can now be
    overridden by library user [Tracker #3830].

- Removed: cmtk::MathUtil::CoefficientOfCorrelation was removed because it
    turned out to be a redundant, numerically unstable variant of
    MathUtil::Correlation
- Removed: deprecated options -m/--metric removed from registration and warp
    tools.
- Removed: obsolete tool skeleton "detect_interleave"
- Removed: obsolete "--threads" option from all remaining command lines; using
    CMTK_NUM_THREADS environment variable is more flexible and versatile.


Release CMTK-0.2.4 (2009-05-11):

- Platforms: vastly improved compatibility with VisualStudio 2008; initial
    implementation of Windows thread parallelism
- Platforms: offer RPM package on Unix/Linux systems and NSIS/ZIP on Windows

- Build: hierarchical SMP control (not complete)

- Changed: symmetry_plane tool now named "sympl"
- Changed: model tool now named "glm"
- Changed: QR decomposition now using AlgLib code

- API: all classes have been moved to cmtk namespace
- API: added "Unstable" library for testing code that is under development.
- API: renamed all file names from igsXXX to cmtkXXX
- API: eliminated obsolete and tedius "igsCoordinateAxis" enum typedef; had to
    change calls to igsUniformVolume::GetDelta() as a result.
- API: moved byte swap functions to System/cmtkMemory.h
- API: renamed most IGS_XXX symbols to CMTK_XXX

- Added: safe C++ array allocator with exception handling; use this for all
    array allocations
- Added: "Unstable" library is no longer built by default, but only when
    enabled in CMake.
- Added: unstable "jidb" tool for joint iterative deblurring
- Added: observe "CMTK_" environment variables in addition to legacy "IGS_"
    variables. The CMTK versions have priority, except for
    IGS_LEGACY_ANALYZE_IO, where either variable will turn legacy mode on.
- Added: "trunc" operator in imagemath tool.
- Added: auto-detect (guess) interleaved axis in interleaved images

- Improved: strict parameter checking for command line callback function
    arguments inside command line class itself

- Testing: three new tests for reformatx tool
- Testing: tests for erosion/dilation in convert tool
- Testing: tests for concat_affine tool
- Testing: tests for mcaffine tool
- Testing: test for paired correlation was using insufficient input data
    (needs at least 2x three images to compute p-values)

- Removed: obsolete VTK/Qt glue glasses
- Removed: obsolete congeal_spim tool

- Bugfix: Nrrd reader now only changes coordinate space to "RAS" if input
    image was defined in anatomy-based coordinate system (RAS, LAS, LPS).
- Bugfix: create igsDataGrid objects without setting anatomical orientation,
    because we may be dealing with non-human data. Instead, set meta data of
    created volumes from input data where possible.

    igsVolume object.

- Added: label stack entropy operator for imagemath tool with test
- Added: test for imagemath vote operator

    pointer was passed to it.
- Bugfix: preserve space axes and direction vectors in 
    igsUniformVolume::GetCroppedVolume()
- Bugfix: centers-of-mass alignment was never working in groupwise_rmi tool;

- Changed: ported GUI classes and applications to Qt4; require at least Qt4.3,
    as we are using features introduced with that version (Issue #13).

    argument, which is equivalent to bringing the warp into its pure nonrigid
    representation.

    constructor; now we no longer look at the volume's own transformation.
- Internal: igsReformatVolume::AffineXform now the actual FORWARD
